6.01E+16,Okay so *VERY DETAILED REVIEW* Recieved the wig came super fast I love that took the hair out didn’t have a bad or funny smell love that as well . Looked at the lace and it did scare me because it was a little darker I’m used to either no color or a lighter color for lace so it did have me nervous hair is very soft tan my finger through it and little to no shedding it has a lot of parting space and does come with an elastic band inside the wig . Came with a wig cap and lashes . I feel like it’s the right length I ordered a 28 inch and after stretching it ( because you do have to stretch curly hair )it’s supposed to be where 28 inch stops on me  … so overall I give 8.5-9 out of 10 mins you I haven’t let my stylist install it yet but I’ll come back if anything changed or see what she says,4.0,2024-10-03,United States

6.01E+16,"I received my package; however, I had to reach out to the seller beforehand regarding their choice of delivery courier, Better Trucks. This company is known for its low ratings and frequent delivery issues. When I raised my concerns with the seller, they completely dismissed them and simply told me to contact my local post office—which makes no sense, as Better Trucks is not a postal service.

Although my package did eventually arrive, it was very late in the evening.

6.01E+16,Honestly I hated the wig at first it was half chopped and the hair  on the top of the lace was horrible had to do a lot of plucking but of course I made it work . I had to add extra layers of bundles to the wig to make it more thicker and cut the bottom to make it even since it was so out of shape I’ll rate it a 10 because I bussed this 8 inch down but the wig itself a 2 of the irresponsible actions they done to this wig . I hope this helps sb if they get the same length because I saw a lot of 8inch comments on here and they all was not lying of how bad it was ..but if you know wyd then you should be good 💯.,3.0,2024-10-24,United States

And God's thanks that 460, not UAH 1200. It's a fee to meet inflatable furniture and don't give it again, god! I looked at the picture with the girlfriend. It does not breathe and after 15-20 minutes, everything on it will be wet from sweat. It is impossible to sit on it, only almost lying. And especially don't scroll. You can only sit with a tie, but try to sit on a 15cm tall slippers. For above, you have to inflate very much, but then it will start to rush on stinkers and tear. The material is quite thin. And try to stick something there! Checked on small similar pillows. Getting it off is the whole problem, because if you turn on your hand to stand, it falls down to your knuff, nothing to do! The best to stand up is to climb the floor and stand up already from it. Inconvenient for Eboračka! Not that only this, but at all, any inflatable furniture I do not recommend.

5.0168E+16,"I found out that when a new member purchases 10 million won from Temu, they give it as a free gift, so I bought it because they gave it a good rating, but the cost is definitely good, but I can't help the limit of low-priced products. The SIM card is blocked, phone is impossible, resolution is HD, and the battery runs out quickly compared to 2mA products. Since this is my first time using a tablet, I recommend purchasing a low-priced product for about 7,000,000 won and a 2,000mA product with an FHD resolution. Since the battery runs out quickly and does not support fast charging, you must always plug in the charging cord when not using it. You can purchase a Korean keyboard scooter for about 2 thousand won, and the memory supports 4GB of virtual memory for 4GB.

6.00895E+16,"The shoes are reasonably comfortable and the extended toe guard provides at least some protection to the sides, much more than the ones i previously used that cost twice the price. I ordered one size up from my normal size and that seems to have been a good decision. After about a week of use at work they seem to be enduring well. My only concerns are that in time the tightening mechanism which is mostly plastic will fail or the tightening cables will break, but for now they are working fine. The shoes did come with a set of laces so in theory i can replace the mechanism with those if needed.  
  
 Another concern is the sole of the shoe seems a bit soft. I am sure it would be fine on a finished concrete floor like in a warehouse, but on a rougher surface like road or parking lot pavement i suspect it will wear down. Still i believe this was a good value.",4.0,2025-03-18,United States

6.00889E+16,"Tldr: overall very sturdy and functional controller. Happy with purchase.  
  
 Pros -  
 =========  
 Surprisingly study controller, but still quite light (compared to dualsense). Strong clamping force (especially with larger phones). Phone grip rubber shaped well to hold the phone and it has angled rubber teeth to grip while letting speaker sound out.  
  
 Can be paired with a pc or used as a regular bluetooth controller.  
  
 Comes with a generously sized carry bag to keep it clean even if the phone is installed (pictured).  
  
 Cons -  
 =======  
 L2/r2 triggers are digital (on/off), so may not be suitable for some games that would like analogue triggers.  
  
 As it's for ""gamers"" it defaults to garish led lit joysticks and buttons when turned on. Easy to disable (turbo+l3/r3) but will reset again when turned on.",,2025-02-15,Australia

Chely,"I honestly canâ€™t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you wonâ€™t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.

My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasnâ€™t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.

The phone was sent via UPS, which I didnâ€™t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didnâ€™t deliver it until 10pm! But thatâ€™s an issue with UPS, not the seller.

When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasnâ€™t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasnâ€™t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.

The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then theyâ€™d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldnâ€™t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and theyâ€™d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didnâ€™t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them Iâ€™d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so Iâ€™d be sending it back with it on.

Life got hectic and I didnâ€™t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.

I went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldnâ€™t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didnâ€™t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I donâ€™t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.

When I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasnâ€™t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).

When I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasnâ€™t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! Itâ€™s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!

I also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!

Between the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!",5.0,2024-09-18,United State
Your Angel,"I recently had the iPhone 11, from games to apps. The dual-camera system took amazing photos, even in low light.

The purple color was a highlight. It was a subtle, elegant shade that looked stylish without being too flashy. The glossy finish on the glass back added a premium feel.

Battery life was impressive, lasting all day with heavy use. The iOS interface was user-friendly and regularly updated. Overall, the iPhone 11 in purple was a great choice for performance, camera quality, and design. Highly recommended!",5.0,2025-02-19,United State
Amanda,The phone is perfect. I ordered it in refurbished excellent condition. The battery health is at 100% and there is not a single scratch or dent on the phone. It looks as if it is brand new out of the box.  It was very easy to set up. I have already used it for texting and phone calls and no issues with speaker or keyboard. Very user friendly and I highly recommend. You canâ€™t beat the price. I bought it in pastel purple.,5.0,2025-02-12,United State
RickS,"I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).

After hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.

A couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as ""excellent.""  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.

To sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than ""excellent condition"".",4.0,2025-01-22,United State
dejah,"Soooo perfect and pretty itâ€™s like brand new. I was scared to get it cause this is my first time ordering a phone from here but trust me itâ€™s beyond my expectations. No scratches, speaker sounds great, not glitchy or slow (which i was scared about), the camera is perfect, and iâ€™m so happy with this purchase, like itâ€™s so worth the money. Trust the reviews itâ€™s a really nice phone you wonâ€™t be disappointed!!!!",5.0,2025-03-11,United State
Great product and affordable,Works well even after I have had it for almost 2 years. I will say when I bought it the battery health was not 100% so seems the battery was not replaced. But still holds a charge and has a pretty good battery life for an older phone. And love the color,5.0,2025-03-04,United State
Benji,This phone is awesome was a little nervous at first buying this because i had never bought a unlocked phone before but i needed to since I have been needing an upgrade from the iPhone 7 i have and I havenâ€™t put service on this new phone yet but all the other features work great and battery compacity was 80% as they said so and phone is in great condition they even shipped it here hella fast would buy from them again!!,5.0,2025-02-10,United State
Renae,"I bought this iPhone 11 on Amazon in 2023 at 85% battery health, and I still have it. It works well, and I havenâ€™t had any major issues. The performance is solid, the camera is good, and it handles daily tasks smoothly. Battery life has held up decently, though it has naturally degraded a bit over time. Overall, a reliable phone and a good purchase!",4.0,2025-02-11,United State
Tiffany,"So far so great, Iâ€™ve been using this phone from Dec  2024 to presentâ€¦.the battery health came at 81% wasnâ€™t good but it was a win because I purchased a iPhone 11 Pro Max with 95% that died 12 days in and I had a bad experience with another company and it was hell to return but eventually I got my refund. This seller shipped within 24 hours and it arrived within 48 hrs. I did my research and found the iPhone 11 is one of the most affordable and reliable 11 models so I took a chance and got  it over the iPhone XR because I really needed a phone that was higher than my iPhone 6 Plus that I had for 6 years. It came brand new, no scratches. Thank you. You should definitely get it.",5.0,2025-03-02,United State

EG,"This shirt is an absolute staple in my wardrobe. From the moment I put it on, the comfort was undeniable. The fabric is soft and lightweight, perfect for staying cool and comfortable all day long. The loose fit and crewneck design make it incredibly versatileâ€”whether Iâ€™m pairing it with jeans for a casual outing or using it as a layering piece under a cardigan.

What I particularly love is the quality of the material. Despite numerous washes, the shirt retains its shape and vibrant color, showing no signs of pilling or fading. The stitching is sturdy, and the overall construction feels solid, so I know itâ€™s built to last.

The short sleeves provide just the right amount of coverage without feeling restrictive. Itâ€™s available in a variety of colors, which makes it easy to stock up on all my favorites. This T-shirt has become my go-to for its blend of style, comfort, and durability.",5.0,2024-10-24,United State

I was not expecting such a well made shirt in a comfortable fabric, variety of colors and flattering design for $10. Iâ€™m 5â€™2â€ 150lbs and medium is roomy without looking frumpy and clinging in the right places to add femininity. I love the 80s slightly off the shoulder style of the rolled shirts. I bought several of the rolled sleeves, plain,  some basic long sleeve  and the Henley Top design with the cute cuffs. They all  have a mature stylish simplicity. They are the perfect shirts for middle aged women who want stylish without dress too old or two young and trendy. It is the perfect semi casual office shirt. It can be dressed up with a blazer, asymmetrical skirt, palazzo pants. I highly recommend any shirt Automet makes and the prices are insanely affordable.

MyBritishComputerGuy,"This blouse is beautiful on, the fabric is so soft, it has a very nice sheen to it. It's like a dull satin, not quite as glossy as a traditional satin. The fabric is a polyester/spandex blend, so not only is it soft but it also has a little stretch to it. The sizing is perfect, but I do have one complaint, the fabric is a little thin and sheer. Around the neckline you can see when it's been folded over to make the collar. You definitely wont want to wear a dark colored bra under it as it will be very visible.

The sleeves are nice and I love the flutter look. The top is finished well and there were no loose seems. The only thing I didn't care for was the elastic loop fastener at the back of the neck, it's rather fiddly to fasten, either the hole was too small or the button is too big. I would recommend fastening it before you put it on. They do also include a spare button which is a nice touch. At 17.99 which is the price at time of my review, I feel this top is pretty good value for money.",4.0,2025-03-07,United State

There is no band along the bottom of the shirt. I am 5'6"" 140 lbs, usually wear a medium. I ordered this in medium and it is a very comfortable fit. The color in my pictures is what the seller calls Apricot. I would call it cream or beige, but nonetheless it's very close to the representative color published by the seller in the listing. There is a small keyhole/button closure at the back of the neck. It's fastened easily with an elastic loop and it holds securely.

Matthew Nelson,"This is a beautiful silky shirt, The black color is classic. The ruffle sleeves are cute and fun. The fabric is comfortable but it wrinkles too easily. I was so excited to try it on I got pictures of it right out of the package. The creases are a little hard to remove because I was worried about ruining the satin fabric.  One problem with this type of fabric is that it can ""cling"" onto the midriff area, if you have a tummy this can be unflattering. I have a bit of a muffin top so that is why I got the black, it's not as noticeable.  I am 5'2"" 120 lbs and I got the M.",4.0,2025-02-25,United State

The color is a beautiful sea foam blue and the style is feminine with the double layer ruffled sleeve. But the stretch in the material is the best. I have some other ""satin silk"" shirts that have no stretch and the stretch and thinner light weight feel of this material makes it feel more like a true silk on the skin. The elastic button closure on back is also easy to do. Comes with an extra button. It does hold some static and light wrinkles but seemed to wash and dry fine.

nanasage1,"I like this blouse! I ordered a blue in medium. The color is no where near as saturated-vibrant as shown in the photos. Mine looks to be almost a pale grayish blue and not the stone blue-aqua shade shown. I fully realize it saves to not have it sent in a separate box but am always disgruntled when an item shows up in the plastic wrapper and nothing else in between. I am thankful it wasnâ€™t wet or dirty.
I orders a size medium and it is a medium fit. I am a size small but always prefer clothes to hang loosely so consistently order up. If you are a 4-6 and prefer a fitted look, order a small. I am 5â€™3.5, 130 lbs, 34DD.
The stitching looks goodâ€¦some loose threads but not a big problem at all as it is obvious fast fashion and my expectations are met.
The detailing is quite pretty! Very sweet sewn in double layered ruffle cap sleeves and a button at the neck in the back. The fabric itself is not genuine silk (duh) so donâ€™t expect that for this price point. Itâ€™s a very feminine design that will go with skirts, slacks, jeans-casual or dressy. I really like this blouse and am grateful to have it! Very pretty. I am thinking I may order it in back. :)

Nikki,"I couldnâ€™t be happier with the Monster Bluetooth Speaker! The sound quality is fantastic, with clear highs and deep, punchy bass that easily fills any space. Itâ€™s perfect for everything from relaxing at home to outdoor gatherings at the beach.

The IPX8 waterproof rating is no joke â€” Iâ€™ve used it in the shower and even by the pool with no worries. The Bluetooth 5.4 connection is super reliable, and Iâ€™ve had zero issues with lag or disconnecting. It pairs quickly with my devices and maintains a strong connection.

Another standout feature is the extra-long battery life. It lasted me through an entire day of music without needing a recharge. Plus, the speaker is surprisingly portable and easy to carry around, making it a great choice for trips and outdoor adventures.

Thereâ€™s alot of hardware in the speaker so itâ€™s heavy. Fast Bluetooth and easy pairing. I can hear itâ€™s 40w. Itâ€™s heavy and bulky but can handle high volume in return.

The microphone connects easily. Thought there is no built in storage for them. So you will need a separate spot to keep them when not in use.

It has a sound effect controller which lets you add giggles, applause, boos, and others sounds.

Sausha,"I started DJing back in 2003 with vinyl being how I learned to do so. I moved to my current state in 2016 and since then have not had my records or equipment with me. I finally got to a point where I couldnâ€™t stand it any longer and just needed something to tide me over until I could finally bring my stuff home. I purchased this controller because I had a limited budget at the time and it seem to come with everything necessary. The speakers are pretty nice quality and will make great monitors. The headphones are comfortable and nice as well. The controller itself is very limited in what you can do and if youâ€™re a beginner itâ€™s perfect, but if youâ€™re an experienced DJ this will not be enough for you; especially if you are only planning on working with the included software Cerrado DJ Lite. That software is super limited and you canâ€™t do much with it. Apparently you canâ€™t record or use the sound effects. As I donâ€™t plan on making the switch to digital tracks a permanent thing, I wonâ€™t be purchasing the full version of the software. So I guess Iâ€™ll have to make do with not recording my mixes for the time being. I would say save your money if youâ€™re more advanced and get some thing that is in fact more advanced. If you just want to hop on the DJ trend and are a beginner this is a really good gateway into the fun of mixing a set. The buttons are very clicky, and itâ€™s easy enough to mix with the sink buttons and such. I do like the fact that there is an option to use the jog wheels like  vinyl  which for somebody like me made the experience a little nicer and familiar. I think this is a great beginner product absolutely, sadly it just makes me miss my records even more.",3.0,2023-08-14,United State

T.D.,"If youâ€™re not a pro DJ and you want to learn, this is ok.  The headphones are way too tight for your ears (If youâ€™re working on the console for over an hour, your ears will hurt because theyâ€™ve been pressed too tightly).  The speakers are also ok.  Theyâ€™re super portable & light! Perfect for practicing.  Sound wise,unfortunately at 15 watts, they donâ€™t have enough â€œoomph!â€ for a good performance. So if you like your bass heavy, this is not for you.  But they are great computer speakers.
The console itself is super light and you do have to learn how to work with it, and itâ€™s good for practicing mixes, BUT, because of the limitation trial Serato software (Serato Lite), there are definitely glitches and inconsistencies.  I have Serato Pro, and I couldnâ€™t use my own program due to licensing, therefore, I would have to spend another $259.00 to buy yet another license/program to use this, which means Iâ€™m spending more money for something that I already have.  The jog wheels arenâ€™t exact when youâ€™re trying to beat match, and good luck with the pitch control, as there is no key lock.

All in all, as I mentioned before, itâ€™s ok for a beginner, but it is not easy to use if youâ€™re a kid, and it could get a little frustrating as a pro.",3.0,2023-02-18,United State

Alex Moschopoulos,"I had originally bought the Starlight just for some fun DJing while I'm sitting on my couch or other times that I don't feel like bringing out the larger setup. I was suddenly given the opportunity to travel for a week and knew I would have a couple of days stuck in my hotel room with little to do. So I thought I would take the controller with, but obviously wanted to protect it. Yeah it's a low-cost controller, but I would still rather spend a little money to protect it rather than have to buy another one if it breaks.

The case is the ideal solution and it's so perfect. Nice and durable so I know it's not going to potentially get damaged even while sitting in my suitcase full of clothing. I like the little zip pouch where I could put some earbuds and the USB controller. The controller fits in there nice and snug so I don't have to worry about it moving around.

Angie,"Used this with a Xumee USB Type C to 3.5mm Headphone and Charger Adapter, 2-in-1 USB C to Aux Audio Jack Hi-Res DAC and Fast Charging Dongle Cable to â€œDJâ€ at a BBQ.
This is the only headphone splitter I found that works with split cuing.  It has a dedicated cable for headphones and speaker- you need this otherwise split cuing will not work. The single dongles that have charging and 2 headphone jacks wonâ€™t work correctly for split cuing. You need this cord.
The cord was a bit expensive imo for what it is but i couldnâ€™t find any other to use. Would have preferred if it was braided and not rubbery as it may not wear well over time. Also would have like if the cord tips were color coded so you could see easily which cord was for headphones and which was for speakers. There are markings on the tips but itâ€™s so small and hard to see. I needed a flashlight to see it. I wrapped blue painters tape on one tip to color code it myself.

Pioneer wants $49 for a replacement splitter, so I bought this TRAKTOR DJ CABLE on a whim. Sure enough, it works perfect, and you can't beat the price! Using an iPad with a USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor, and WeDJ software. Now we have full (mono) sound coming out of both speakers and both sides of the headphone monitor for cueing.

Jeff,This works great if you want to hook two oonz angle 3 speakers in stereo.  I did this for a tv.  Install the cable into your headphone jack.  Hook your right speaker into the plug with the headphone symbol.  Hook your left speaker into the plug with the speaker symbol.  Thats it!  Makes a great sound bar set up on the cheap.  Offcourse you need to hook up your usb cables to a charger to keep your speakers powered.  This cable is perfect for such an application.  It splits the left and right channels out to the two  sockets.  Then at the socket it sends either the left or right out on both sides of the plug.  So in my case.. my left oontz gets left sound to both speakers in the one enclosure.. and my right speaker gets right sound to both speakers in the one enclosure.  Perfect!,5.0,2018-08-14,United State
Matthew Langen,"I used this cable in conjunction with an iPad 2 with Traktor DJ to DJ for a dance at my high school. Until I found this cable, I thought I needed a soundcard, but those are much more expensive, and Im not looking to invest that kind of money just yet. This cable did the job, and did it well. I was able to prelisten to one track in my headphones, and play out the other through the speakers. It was the perfect solution. The build quality is great, and I highly recommend this cable to anyone who is starting out DJing and is looking for a quick, cheap way to prelisten to tracks.",5.0,2014-04-09,United State
Allen Slucher,"Works flawlessly! Remember to use the correct outputs that are engraved onto each end! I use this with my iPad Air and Djay2. I also use these all in tandem with my Hercules board and PA speakers for a summertime gig. Got this early to prepare and do test runs in different areas, and it works beautifully every time. My favorite part about this cable, the connections are very solid, no chance of falling out during a show!

I know this isn't on the maker of the cable, which is why the stars weren't docked for this, but there is an insanely annoying notification while using the Djay2 app. It pops up and reminds you every time you change in and out of the app and when you get in and out of the settings and such. I get it. Tell me it's splitting the output, but they are forgetting the buttons already made to tell me the same thing on the top of each channel. If someone was that into the app to get the cable, I think they know when they are splitting the output... Just saying",5.0,2015-03-07,United State
Brett S.,I did not purchase this for DJ'ing purposes so I can't speek to it's utility there. I needed a way to split the output my Creative Labs Audigy FX2 card uses for the Center and Sub channels. On these (and most cards) these two channels are provided by one 3.5mm jack. For this to work properly you need to split the left and right channels. The speakers I was using were expecting stereo signals though so I had to split a L/R signal to a L/L stereo 3.5mm and R/R stereo 3.5mm. Previously I was splitting this with either a bunch of 3.5mm to RCA adapters to split and then merge the signals. This product does exactly what I needed without a bunch of additional adapters.,5.0,2023-05-03,United State

Paul Pardee,"For the price, the microphone is fantastic.  For voice-overs, it's not lacking in any way.  The audio is clear and true-to-life.  It's a cardioid pattern, so it does a decent job of rejecting room noise.

The stand works and is even able to clamp on to chunky IKEA desktops.  It's hard to get it tightened down to the right amount to make it adjustable by just moving it to where you want the mic to be, but if you just want to hold the mic in the right place, it works well enough.  It does a pretty good job of isolating the mic from vibrations/bumps to the surface it's mounted on, too.

The mic comes with both a pop guard and wind sock.  I haven't heard any difference with or without them, but I'm also not talking directly into the mic.",5.0,2025-02-17,United State
Taiki,"Considering the price of this setup, I was skeptical about the quality of the microphone and arm. However, I am pleasantly surprised!

The microphone guard can be a bit tricky to position correctly, but once you set it, it stays in place. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase, and it is definitely worth considering.",5.0,2025-02-24,United State
ShutterBuddy,"I've been doing my research on microphones for use with a new Podcast series that my friend and I want to start as well as some YouTube product review videos.  First off, compared with the two previous mics that I had, this thing is amazing for the price and when you consider everything you get with the package it's the best place to start.

The stand is sufficient and holds everything very steady and is fully adjustable with some good tensioning knobs to keep it in place.  The pop filter fits nicely although I like to just use the wind foam that slides over the mic itself.  It's sounds the same and allows me to keep a clearer view of my desk and my monitor.  The best part is the sound quality.  Is it the best mic out there--no--but with a bit of tuning in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) you'll be amazed at how good of a recording you can get from this it.  I like everything about it so far.  One thing to keep in mind is that if you back away too far from the Mic, even with the gain up, your voice is going to sound more ambient.  Keeping your face 2-4 inches from the mic produces clear and well detailed audio.  The USB option just works perfectly on my Mac, and on my PC--although I use this with GarageBand on my Mac.  If you're just starting out and you want all the bells and whistles for recording your voice for well under $100 you can't go wrong with this setup.  Enjoy!

UPDATE 4/16/2019 - I'll need to strike my comment about the mic being more abient as I pull back, that is a function of the space I'm sitting in.  I'm going to add some curtains and sound insulating panels to some the open areas of my new home studio to reduce the echos that the room produces.  This is one sensitive mic!  Also, something that just blew my mind.  I realized that my desk was too deep for the extension arm that came with the mic so I surfed around and realized that Maono also had a mic setup like this with a desktop mic stand (using a weighted base).  I reached out to them and asked if I could purchase that stand separately, letting them know how much I loved their mic setup.  At first they said that they don't offer the stand separately, but then decided to just mail me the stand free of change.  That's right, ""FREE OF CHARGE!""  I was so blown away by this.  Talk about customer service.  Don't let the lower price fool you folks, these are good folks and their product is worth serious consideration before you drop a lot more money on something that might be as good or even less.  I can't imaging needing something better for podcasting and youtube video production.",4.0,2019-04-10,United State
Kitty,"I needed a microphone to record some How-To videos for my work. Using the laptop microphone left me sounding tinny and picked up a lot of background noise. Since this would be days of recording and editing I decided to bit the bullet and buy a professional mic.

I'm really satisfied with this Microphone! It looks great and was easy to set up.
It automatically paired with my laptop with no drivers needing to be downloaded.
I was able to make adjustments to it in my settings and once I realized I also had to switch it to this Mic as my default in Zoom I was all set.

It picks up my voice loud and clear while minimizing background noises.
I don't notice much difference with the windshield on or off, but I leave it on just to be safe.
I also like that I can attach it to my desks and it has several different ways it can be adjusted and when not in use I can push it off to the side  without having to break it down.

I think the only thing I truly struggled with was putting on the wind shield. I wish there was a better picture with instructions. It wasn't really covered in the instruction booklet. I eventually figured it out and got it to fit like in the picture on Amazon.

Jeff H.,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!

When purchasing electronic gadgetry, I rarely go the 'cheap' route.  I started my research with the expectation of purchasing the Blue Yeti combo which includes the mic, shock mount and scissor arm.  But at $300 I wasn't sure if I really needed to go all-in for it.  After thoroughly searching reviews and comparing products I decided I'd give this Maono combo pack a go.  It comes with the condenser mic, scissor arm, shock mount, and pop filter.  The price point of about $60 left me wondering just what I'd be getting but figured if it was terrible, I'd return it, use it somewhere else or simply replace it with a better unit.

I'm not a BIG podcaster but have multiple online meetings, participate in events and want to get more into podcast hosting in the future but mostly just wanted a unit I could keep on hand, ready to go and push it out of the way when not needed.  Perhaps my bar for expectation was too low given the price point but I'm VERY impressed with this set up for the price.

The installation was an absolute breeze.  In fact, it was so easy, I didn't even look at the instructions until the end as I thought I had to have missed something.  I was able to get it set up in probably 5 minutes and it is truly plug and play with your PC (Windows 10).  I plugged it into my USB hub, the PC immediately recognized it and I was ready to go.  I did a quick test of mic volume and level and it sounds awesome.  All the attachments are intuitive, easy to adjust and attach.  As you can see on the one picture, I have the arm attached to the back side of my stand-up desk.  It's secure and very easy to swing out of the way.  The arm is plenty adjustable, swings easily and I  can position the mic in any number of positions based on what I'm needing.  I have yet to use the pop filter and probably won't unless I'm on a very important podcast/show.

As far as the mic itself, couldn't ask for more.  Levels appear good.  Volume is good.  The only thing to be aware of is that it is a directional mic and, therefore, you need to make sure the ""Maono"" name and logo on the mic are facing you when mounting it.  If you don't, it's going to sound like you are in a closet or under your desk when talking.  I tested it in a number of different distances and angles and it has great sensitivity and volume.  It has only been two days since I've been using it so I can speak to the durability of the parts, pieces or electronics but everything appears well made, solid and durable.  The others on my meeting said I sounded great.

I would, without a doubt, purchase this product again and am very glad I saved the $250 to go this route first.  Two big thumbs up for this Maono product at this price point.",5.0,2020-08-18,United State
Rembrandt,"At first, this USB microphone worked greatâ€”clear sound, easy setup, and a good option for streaming or calls. The audio quality was solid for the price, and it was plug-and-play with no issues.
However, after just a few months, the cord started having problems. It became finicky, only working when positioned a certain way, and eventually stopped working altogether. I reached out to get a replacement, but customer support was unhelpful, and I was stuck with a mic I couldnâ€™t use.
For the price, itâ€™s okay if you need something short-term, but the lack of durability and poor support make it hard to recommend long-term. If you get this, be ready to replace the cableâ€”or the whole micâ€”sooner than youâ€™d expect. Very versatile and comes with a compatibility adapter.",3.0,2025-02-11,United State
Katrina Fox-Gardner,"This microphone is serving me well. Still. I got it a few years ago I think and the audio quality is as good as when I got it.

Also be mindful of mic placement and environment - echos etc. YouTube is a good place to start for tutorials.",5.0,2025-03-04,United State

Nathan,"When I purchased these headphones to quietly practice guitar, I never knew how much I'd end up enjoying these headphones for any application. They provide good, neutral sound quality for lower price than expected, offer good ear and head comfort for long spans of use time, and have great room for many applications due to their sleek look and ease of use.

A couple issues I've run into would be cable slipping from the female audio jack in the headphones, and the earmuffs are breaking down and flaking. These problems could be attributed to age, but it is an indication to the expected lifetime.

Overall, I'm very pleased with these studio headphones. They come with quality sound and excellent sound stage and clarity for a cheap price, which is the main reason I purchased in the first place.  Good job Maono!",5.0,2024-07-10,United State
JJ,"The headphones some in very nice packaging and have instructions as well. The cord and headphones can be separated too, which is incredibly useful in avoiding damage during transport! The design is useful in the fact that not only does it have an ear jack that connects to either side of the headphone, there's two sizes in the case that a larger jack is needed. It doesn't come with the ability to chance the size eith the sliders on each size if they are too big or small, and the sliders have yet to create any sort of situation in which I would have to resize it again. The fit is very comfortable, especially for lomg periods of use. The audio is clear and crisp, allowing for full immersion when they are on. All in all the headphones function as they should and possibly even better than other expensive headphones. I'd say they are incredibly good for the price!",5.0,2024-09-26,United State
Rampaul S.,"I recently bought the MAONO 50MM Drivers Studio Headphones AU-MH601 and I'm absolutely thrilled with them. The sound quality is amazing, with clear highs, rich mids, and deep bass that make music, movies, and audio editing a pleasure.

The headphones are well-built and feel sturdy. The ear cups are very comfortable, even for long listening sessions, and the adjustable headband fits perfectly. The noise isolation is excellent, letting me enjoy my audio without distractions.

I also love the versatility of these headphones. They come with both a 3.5mm cable and a 6.35mm adapter, so they work with a variety of devices.

Ryno's Stuff,"For a budget pair of studio monitor headphones, these are exceptional.  The soundstage is close to neutral and there is zero line noise.  I can hear every detail as I record and edit the audio for my videos. They even look good!  Haha.

As I've said in the past, I'm no audiophile.  I've just got regular ears that enjoy music....So here's a review from a regular eared person.

I have another set of over-ear monitors (ATH-M40X) that are double the price.  I've had them since 2015 and they're still going strong.  Honestly after five years of using those and a week of using these...There isn't that big of a difference!  Strange as it sounds, these are very close in audio quality.  I'd say the M40X is a bit more neutral, but these are not far off.

Pros
1.  Neutral  - not a huge amount of added bass, treble, mids, highs, lows, whatever.  Almost FLAT.  Highs are a bit more pronounced than with the M40X, but that could also be because these carry 50mm drivers as opposed to the 40mm drivers on the M40X.
2.  50mm drivers - huge, clean sound.  Nothing was muddy at any volume.
3.  Comfort - lightweight and very well padded.  They fit my giant head without causing pressure, even after several hours of use at a time.
4.  Connections - 3.5mm OR 6.35mm connections.
5.  Cable - this twisted cable.  It's SHORT, too, so no extra cable dangling on the floor or bundled up on the desk.  Perfect for small studio spaces where everything is right at hand.

Predominantly, I will be using these in recording and editing voices for my videos.  For that scenario, these are fantastic.  Lots of detail.  MOANO just does a great job with budget studio equipment.

I've also used these to listen to some music - ran them through my usual series of headphone testing songs.  Everything sounded fantastic.  I connected these to my phone with Hi-Fi DAC, to my laptop with Hi-Fi DAC, to my Hi-Res MP3 player/DAC, and to my home stereo system.  The sound remains just about the same no matter how I'm connected or what I'm connected to.  The LG V60 is powerful enough to run these!  Seriously, nothing sounded off or weird.  All genre of music sounded exactly the way the artists intended.

These studio monitors are really an exceptional buy.  My only complaint is that the cups don't rotate like on the M40X.  Not that big of a deal, though.  I really like these.",5.0,2020-06-07,United State
Jessica T.,"(The video is comparing the HyperX Cloud Revolver to the MAONO AU-MH601, this is an edited transcript from it)

The box comes with an informational packet and a baggie that contains the audio cord.
There's not much cushioning, but no company riff-raff either, just the key things you need. As long as your UPS driver ain't yeeting your packages, it should be ok.

 The AU has some interesting features. A 3.5mm jack and 6.35 jack, which...I haven't really seen before, if you use equipment that requires that then there you go. It also supports headset sharing! If you and the bois got some MAONOS together, it's gonna be pretty lit. However, it lacks external media control and doesn't have a microphone...which is why it doesn't get a 5 star for gaming. The cord is spiral-ly, which helps prevent tangling, but might be awkward when extending it, so it's up to you to decide if its a pro or con.  I like that the jack is on an angle because it will help prevent cord damage.

 Looking at build quality, it's quite good. The ear cups are soft and cushiony, so very comfortable (I prefer over-ear for comfort, but these deliver pretty well). The plastic that makes up the frame is high quality and sturdy. The headphones can also fold in to save space which is a plus. The noise cancelling is also pretty decent.

Overall, the AU is an excellent headset even when compared to a higher-end headset. For only $43 the AU rocks out",5.0,2020-08-06,United State
EJ Juarez,"This DJ headset is only useful if youâ€™re a basshead. This is not for enjoying the musical detail with the highest frequencies. I used this product by driving it by the tube amps connected with a solid amp and my DAC, but the audio is not as sharp as the AmazonBasics DJ headphones. So I switched to the Amazon product. But months later, one channel of my AmazonBasics headphones wore out like plastic-wrap wrinkles as it was punching heavy levels of low-frequency bass notes, killing the driver (Levels were manipulated virtually using Equalizer APO on my PC with multiple settings of Peaking Filter around 34Hz at 30 db and Low Shelf at the highest levels of 50hz with additional high High Shelf Filter levels (I donâ€™t remember), and with another additional set of raised levels of lowest frequencies at a variable-band equalizer controls that all of that caused the heavy-punching channel to wear out gradually and made it incredibly unenjoyable and less audible). So at the same time after the Amazon headset died, I had these Kuno (?) (I canâ€™t get to the brandâ€™s name of the product on this review while Iâ€™m reviewing) headset as a spare to enjoy the punching bass. Guess what....??? This headset has also died with one channel wearing out again like a plastic-wrap wrinkle. So Iâ€™m currently using my Hi-Res clip monitor earbuds. Their feel and audio quality is amazing but the clipped earbuds make me uncomfortable for little long wear while being clipped at my ears. So I will try to get a Hi-Res Pioneer headset or a HIFIMAN product instead.",3.0,2021-02-18,United State

.,"Review for 'MAONO USB/XLR Podcast Dynamic Microphone, Studio Mic Kit with Volume Control, Shock Mount, Pop Filter, Ideal for Vocal, Instruments Recording, Voice Over, Live Streaming (HD300T)'

This mic was only $50 AND it came with an adjustable stand, pop filter, and shock mount.  Buying the accessories separately would cost more than the mic!  I didn't try the stand as I purchased a heavy duty SnakeClamp and 5/8"" adapter (check them out, seriously, SnakeClamp is amazing!) for my setup which supports the weight of the mic and my headphones.

This is a dynamic mic so it is rather quiet (not much gain) but that means it also doesn't pick up background noise as much as a condenser mic would.  Additionally it has a supercardioid polar pattern to reject off axis coloration, especially from the sides.  Those two aspects combined make it great for rooms where you'll have a little background noise, especially from the side.  In my case I have a window mounted A/C unit that I must run continuously in the summer because someone thought a split level house in a desert wouldn't be a problem :/  I still hear the A/C when I am not talking, but it's presence is reduced and since I'm directly in front of the mic my voice completely overshadows it.  Discord and Zoom both have background noise cancellation which eliminates it in those applications.

Although the sample rate is 44.1/48kHz (the minimum you'd find on any mic worth buying) this is more than enough for voice chat, streaming, etc.  Since the mic's bit depth is 16 bit, at 44.1kHz sample rate, the bit rate is 705.6Kbps.  At 48kHz sample rate, the bit rate is 768Kbps.  An unboosted Discord server's voice channels max out at 96Kbps and a fully boosted one at 384Kbps which is still well below the mic's bit rate output.  From what I can find, a Zoom Pro account can have a sample rate as high as 48kHz and this mic reaches that.  Basically, unless you're planning on recording in a lossless format such as FLAC, the ""low"" sample rate of this mic is a non-issue.

The bit depth of 16 bits is bare minimum for audio accuracy, and is a minor negative, but again outside of recording this still doesn't have much of an impact as at 24 bits, the bit rate would be 1152Kbps and for anything realtime over the Internet it would be compressed.

Though it comes with a pop filter, it's a little bit janky TBH.  It works, but does take some fiddling to get set up correctly.  Protip: insert the mic into the shock mount, attach the pop filter to the little metal arm, THEN insert the arm+filter assembly into the shock mount.

The mic allows for connecting via USB or XLR, and though I haven't tried it, I saw in reviews that both can be used simultaneously if you needed that for some reason.  Unlike most (all?) of the other USB/XLR combo mics this one is USB-C on the mic end.  The best benefit of this dual output is you can connect the mic directly to your PC via USB, but you also have the option to run it through a mixer or audio interface.  So if you're on the go you can connect to your laptop with USB, then at home plug in through XLR.  This also opens the door to exploring the world of digital audio if you decide to purchase a mixer/audio interface later.  Technically it can connect directly to PC with an XLR to 1/8"" adapter cable, but you'll have to basically swallow the mic and max the gain on your PC to hear it.  I suspect this would be true for any dynamic mic.

tl;dr is that this is probably the best mic you can get at this price point if your use case is streaming, gaming, voice chat, or any other realtime online voice application.  The USB+XLR output provides outstanding flexibility and opens the door for anyone new to the audio space to get their feet wet with a mixer or audio interface.  If you intend to do recording this is not a good fit.  Consider the 'audio-technica ATR2100x-USB' which is a very comparable mic, but with higher bit depth and sample rates.",5.0,2024-05-08,United State
Denis,"I'm setting up a home studio for voiceover work, and my old condenser mics weren't what I needed. I've got a lot of background noise, so I needed a dynamic mic that would suppress the background sound (mostly the air conditioning, which is quite loud even with the door shut- the main unit is right outside my room.)

Since I didn't want to spend my money on sound treatment for the room, which would be cost-prohibitive for a part-time endeavor, I took a chance on this Maono Carotid Dynamic Microphone- and it's been great!

The carotid pickup naturally suppresses the background sounds, and the mic sounds really good with my voice; I keep the mic fairly close to my mouth, and the pop filter that comes with it does a great job of suppressing the plosives (Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickles, etc.) so my voice sounds really natural and full-toned. It's clear and neutral, I don't hear any coloration from the mic itself, and it does a great job with the lower tones. I'm a baritone, and some dynamic mics make me sound like Mickey Mouse, but this one makes me sound more like Barry White! The pop filter could be bigger, and the rod that screws into the filter could be more robust, but that's a minor quibble- pop filters are a dime a dozen, and this one does the job as long as it's directly in front of the mic.

I'm running the mic into my PreSonus 24c interface, but that's not even necessary, since this dynamic mic doesn't need 48v phantom power like most condenser mics do. This microphone can plug directly into a USB port on a computer or laptop, and it'll work just fine! In fact, with it plugged into my computer I get even more functionality- there's zero latency (no delay) when I plug your headphones (with 3.5mm stereo plug) into the rear of the microphone, and that's great: I hear exactly what the mic is picking up, and exactly what my voice sounds like before any EQ!

When the mic is plugged into a USB port (USB 2 or 3, both work fine,) there's a volume control for headphones & the mic lights up with inbuilt green LED light, which looks fantastic. There's a manual On-Off switch that works both with USB and XLR. I can also have the mic plugged into an XLR input on my interface, and also have it plugged into my computer, simultaneously. I'm amazed at what this inexpensive mic can do!

The kit with the mic includes everything I needed to get the mic set up & working, and the shock mount for the mic is really good. I don't have any desk space, so I don't use the mic stand which came with the mic (though it's well-made and sturdy,) but a scissor-arm bracket which I already had; the shock mount fit perfectly into the scissor-arm mic holder, no adapters needed.

All in all, I'm delighted with this Maono HD-300T microphone, it's exactly what I was looking for and it sounds a heck of a lot better than its price point would suggest!",5.0,2021-09-30,United State
Samuel Reed,"I'm going to be honest, I mostly got this Mic because a dynamic mic with such a robust accessory package for this price is basically unheard of.

Overall, it's been good - though, if you're kind of soft-spoken, keep in mind that dynamic mics require you to get much closer and be a little louder than condensers. The quality, however, is crisp and clear, and the accessories package is ... well, *mostly* good.

One thing definitely worth noting is that now, after several months of use, one of the sets of elastics in the shock mount *did* just rot through and snap - and when I say 'sets' I mean both of the ones on the back part of the mount. The front ones are hangin' in there, but I can see they're starting to crack too. I'll definitely need to get, at least, new elastics soon - possibly just a new shock mount if I can't find just the bands.

So, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably technically is, haha! But everything else is still functional and working well. Only other issue I've had is a couple of times over the months of use, friends have reported a bad, weird buzzing sound, but unplugging and re-plugging has solved it instantly - overall still quite happy with my purchase and would recommend it.",4.0,2024-02-18,United State
Temporary Amazon User,"I don't know much about microphones so was doing some online research.

I was previously using my Samson Q2U after having it highly recommended by some YouTuber videos & articles I had read for condenser mics on a budget (which I'd also recommend).

I decided to buy another one for my co-host on a passion project podcast, Dorm Dialogues, to use and landed on this one. [This particular microphone is used in the episode about Matt rife lol, anything before that was the Samson]. I love the shock protection integration with the stand and that it comes with a pop filter (the Samson one doesn't, which put me at ~10 bucks more than the given price)

I like the overall setup, as well as the heavy base and the adaptable plug-in.

Captain Frugal,"I am very impressed with this mic, first off it seems much more sturdy that what you would normally find at this price point. The mic itself is built well and the stand is pretty sturdy as well. I don't see any issues using the stand it is built well enough to hold up to many years of use.  I tested this mic extensively with the USB and XLR connections and compared it to a MXL 2003, Blue Yetti, and a Sure SM57 and this mic compares very well.
The one thing I found that could be improved is the way the pop filter screws onto a post and is mounted to the stand, I was afraid it would break when I was screwing it on.
Overall this mic is a great value for the money and I would recommend it to anyone that needs a mic but does not want to spend over $100 dollars. For what you get with this kit I really think you will be off to a great start it will get you all of the things you need for your audio at a price that wont break the bank and yet you wont sacrifice sound or product build quality in any way.

AwesomeShot,"If you're looking for a well-built, clean sounding, good-looking microphone for your podcasting, video-conferencing, or vocal needs, you're going to have a hard time beating the AU-HD300. It punches well above it's price tag in terms of quality, features and ease of use. The classic look and style is reminiscent of my AKG P5 mic, but the additional capabilities of the built-in USB C interface and headphone out makes it much easier to use with a computer.
Handle-mounted system volume control and on/off switch are also a nice addition. The Cardioid pattern means good sound rejection from behind the mic, so keyboard noises are minimized, and the output is clean, with a low noise-floor. The only caveat to note is that the frequency response dips around 60Hz, and again above 16KHz, so it might not be the ideal choice for instruments such as piano, brass, or drums. But it's more than capable as a vocal mic, and the desktop accessories included means you don't need to go on a purchase spree to get this in use right away.",5.0,2021-06-30,United State

When I switched the microphone I went to the sound settings to see how it sounds and it didnâ€™t work. So I tired XLR and that didnâ€™t work I went back to USB-C and no luck. I even downloaded an app to try to connect it and nothing. Honestly at this point after all the wait and hype itâ€™s not worth the purchase.

Bryan Davis,"Large purchaser of gaming related tech and hardware here.

This is an absolute MUST have for the Xbox gamer in your life or for yourself. This has impeccable clear and crisp audio quality. It gives a great audio feedback so you can hear how you sound into the mic and control the gain level. This transmits the audio directly as intended through Xbox's strict rules (since you can't plug in just any typical USB mic) through the auxiliary on the controller.

This is a fantastic mic. I set mine up with a podcast boom arm with 0 issues and screwed right onto the standard piece and the setup is complete. It has 3 color changing modes that one would typically expect from RGB lit devices like pulse, fast change, and slow breath. I'm someone that wants to sound great while streaming and hear great sound quality. This helps me do both seamlessly due to Xbox's restrictions on microphone capabilities. The mic also is wireless technically, it is battery rechargeable, lasts a good solid 8-10 hours for me so far without the lights on which I don't need. It features a very sensitive and nice one tap to mute with red light indication for muting input so no one can hear when tapped. I recommend a splitter if anyone would like to hear both phone / pc audio and game audio simultaneously to go along with this as it will work. I appreciate the thoughtfulness overall and will have this brand on my radar in the future.

Value for your money: At around $60 this is a high-end mic for a low end price. Great value, impeccable and impressive.
Functionality: This mic fully met and exceeded expectations with use. The quality and clarity is fantastic.
Weight: The mic is very light, it doesn't weigh down or cause my mic arm to drift down at all. Other podcast style microphones will be metal and heavy, this is a nice matte plastic.

Cons:
I almost don't want to say because I have been looking for a product like this for some time now, but as with all things there can be improvements. You cannot use the microphone at all while it is charging with the Type C. Highly suggest making changes to that and or making a totally wire powered version.

This mic fixes everything! High quality sound, FAST set up, and enough tuning capability with only one knob to give your game chat the volume they need to hear you crisp and clear. Looks sweet with the lights going, and they respond when you mute it too to ensure you mute up. Literally just buy it, it plugs in and works immediately.

MD,"I recently purchased 3 of these mics. I have higher end studio mics and have been doing pro audio for decades, but needed some cheap USB mics for teleconferences, and for my kids to use for school. The AUDIOPRO USB Microphone Cardioid Condenser is not a ""pro"" grade mic, but it is surprisingly good for the low price. The sound quality for speech is quite nice, and it would be a great podcasting mic. Speech sounds nice thick, and it has a windscreen. It is not a papery thin sound like some cheap mics. It may not be the best for recording singing and instruments due to a jumpy dynamic range. But it is not bad for a new musician getting their first mic to start learning to record. Just know that you will need a software compressor to get good singing and instrument sound to tone down the dynamic range. It was true plug and play on 3 different Windows 10 PC's, and all of the knobs/buttons are functional. There is not much noticeable latency. All three mics are functioning as intended. The only issue I noticed was the built in preamps are not consistent... one gets really loud and needs to be backed out to avoid clipping, one is sort of medium, and one is a bit quieter even with the knob turned all the way up. But overall, this is a great value for a USB mic. I hope they last a long time... we shall see.",4.0,2024-02-14,United State

EternianUber,"Seems to be a good microphone. I don't have a very booming voice so when testing it I found I needed to turn the mic volume all the way up for my voice to come across clearly. I'd say that's good though. Probably best to do that and if you're the type that likes to talk at the top of your voice then you can use the mic volume knob to dial it down a little if needed.

From what I can tell everything about the mic functions well. It's not too big, not too small, feels very solid as far as the build quality, and the price was great. I'd say it's a great entry level microphone with the functions that matter.",5.0,2025-03-06,United State
Romidar,"This mic won't be suitable for all usersâ€”see the Â«MAJOR ""MINUS""Â» section below.

I got the mic to record music practiceâ€”not expecting audiophile quality. What sold me: Android compatibility and affordable price.

The mic is compatible with my Pixel phone. As soon as I connected it, the phone recognized a new USB device and the mic's power-on LED lit up. It worked fine out of the boxâ€”no need to adjust any phone settings.

Plugging the mic into an iPhone 12 isn't activating the LED. That aside, it's working ok with that phone.

PACKAGING: Even though you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, I'm impressed by the high-quality packaging.

BUILD QUALITY: I don't know enough to judge build quality of devices like this. But it certainly feels solid overall, and so do the two main knobsâ€”no wobbling.

The tightening knobs holding the mic at an angle do the job but don't fully lock the mic in place. (Trying to tighten them extra-hard probably isn't a good idea.)

SOUND QUALITY: As far as I can tell sound reproduction is just fine for voice. Even with the gain cranked up I'm not hearing distortion. I'll have to leave any technical criticism to the audiophiles.

They recommend angling the top of the mic away from you. I'm not hearing a lot of difference when it's straight upright, though.

When the base is in direct contact with a tabletop, the mic picks up even slight vibrations. Setting the base onto dense Â½â€³ foam eliminates that kind of extraneous noise.

As for recording percussion practices...it isn't what the mic is designed for. But it does an ok job. So far it hasn't been great about picking up the lowest bass notes. (It's possible that I'm not positioning it correctly.) With middle and high ranges it's not bad. It will work well for my purposes.

MAJOR ""MINUS"": The mic doesn't have a soft-touch mute button, but rather a pushbutton with a distinct Â«clickÂ». You'll definitely hear it in a recording. I don't know why they designed it that way. I knew it didn't have a soft-touch button before I bought it and hoped the button would at least operate quietly. Alas, no. Annoying!

MINOR DRAWBACK: Minor design flawâ€”the markings under the gain and headset-volume knobs are very faint and hard to read (Why?).

INSTRUCTIONS: The documentation is clear and covers use with Windows, MacOS, and mobile phones. (One notable omission...see below.)

TROUBLESHOOTING TIP: At first I thought there was a defect in the product or a bug in the recorder app on my phone. I could tell the microphone was working but couldn't play recordings through the phone's speakers (which I knew were otherwise ok).

Turns out that at least with the Pixel phone, its speakers are disabled when the phone and mic are connected. Simple fix: Just disconnect them. This should be mentioned in the documentation, but isn't.

OVERALL: Satisfied. Loses one star for the irritatingly clicky mute button. 3 stars for now until I know how it's holding up. 4 stars later, if no issues.

Conclusion: It's a good price for a mic with solid build and high enough quality for someone with my (non-professional) requirements.",3.0,2024-09-28,United State

Kevin,"My wife conducts a Zoom call with our 4 daughters each week.  I had to replace her Mac with an updated Mac Mini.  As you all know, it does not have an onboard microphone.  I also had to provide a monitor.........all of which cost less than a desktop Mac these days.  Anyway, I provided her a high quality camera that had an onboard microphone.  My girls kept telling her that she was hard to hear and when they could hear her, it sounded more like a ""robot"" speaking.  So......I did one more research project to find a good quality microphone.  This product, AIRHUG 21, with AI noise suppression did the trick.  It is a small form factor with a normal sound pickup response that most folks will use, but it also has a noise suppression element that can be turned on, reducing or eliminating background noise like dog barking, or a robot vaccum doing its thing.  My girls raved about how clear their Mom's voice was on the call today.  I was a hero for choosing this microphone.  It is excellent and small for desktop use as well as easily portable.

Exosurfshack,"FIX FOR DOCKING STATION USE BELOW

First off, it was hard to gauge the size of this device based on other user photos. Xbox Series controller next to it for reference.

I was tired of using my work provided headset(Logitech H570e) because wires are annoying and I work from home, so closed audio communication isnâ€™t needed. I was also browsing stuff like the Jabra2 line but too costly.

I have the EMEET sitting at the end of my desk and people can hear me just fine. The microphone quality is comparable to the headset. Both leagues better than the laptop microphone.
The speaker is plenty loud and others cannot hear themselves when iâ€™m talking to them on Teams, or Jabber.
The product itself works great overall. Plug and play use when the usb cable is directly connected to my laptop.

However, I ran into issues when I plugged the EMEET into my Dell WD19S docking station. I plug everything into it, so that way all I have to plug into my laptop is the usb-c cable.
When listening to audio from a youtube video, the speaker works fine. When you try to run something that requires the speaker and microphone to both be in use(teams, jabber) the speaker will continually disconnect and reconnect over and over while also trying to find a usable audio source such as the laptop speakers, making it impossible to communicate. The microphone will work, so others can hear you, but you canâ€™t hear them due to the speaker connection issue.

I tried updating the drivers on my laptop and docking station, I tried going into advanced audio settings and not allowing other audio sources to connect, I set the EMEET as priority, I googled forums from other people experiencing issues with their docking stations and similar devices, I downloaded the EMEET software provided on their website, nothing worked.

IT with my company worked on it for 30 min as well with no luck. I called EMEETâ€™s support team and with no troubleshooting, they told me itâ€™s likely the docking station at fault but ehhhhh I donâ€™t know about that, chief.

I did not want to plug the EMEET into my laptop just for it to work. I also did not want to run strictly bluetooth as iâ€™d have to recharge it. That defeats the purpose of why I got this(cables, handsfree, tidy, etc)

THE FIX:

As stated before, when the EMEET is plugged into the docking station and iâ€™m making a call, the microphone is the only thing that works correctly.

To get the speaker to work, I paired the EMEET to my laptop via bluetooth. Since the EMEET is also still plugged into the docking station, it will show two speaker sources and two microphone sources.

On windows, go to system, sound, output.
It should show two sources from EMEET. One labeled Speaker, One labeled headset. The one labeled headset is your bluetooth connection. The one labeled Speaker is your wired connection. Click on the Speaker source, under general, audio, select â€œdonâ€™t allowâ€.

This will make it to where the Speakers bluetooth connection is your output source, and the microphone wired connection is your input source.

Unit is still hardwired in so you donâ€™t have to charge it, and it resolves the connectivity issues with the docking station.

Would be 5 stars if docking station compatibility were there.",4.0,2024-08-16,United State

If you're having trouble to have the Bluetooth dongle to work properly.  Here are a few steps you to need to do. 1. Turn on Bluetooth. 2. Look for the related settings on the right side of the screen. Look for the more Bluetooth options.  A new window will pop up. 3. On the options tab. Look for discovery. Check the box and allow bluetooth devices to find your PC. Click OK. Problem solved. Oh and another thing. If you're dongle isn't recognizing any Bluetooth devices. Simply remove dongle from USB port and re insert to usb port. For some reason if the dongle sits in port for too long. It won't work.,5.0,2025-03-12,United State
Jack M. Engle,"I almost never leave a review for a product, but I felt inclined to do so for this as it solved an issue I'd been trying to deal with for years. I had so many issues with the built-in bluetooth in Windows where it would connect to my devices but give a spotty connection at best. This happened for any bluetooth device from earbuds to an Xbox controller.

I finally gave this a try, and I'm happy to report it's working extremely well. You do need to make sure you disable the current bluetooth adapter (if your machine has one) before installing this. Once I did that, I was able to pair multiple devices without issue and I've had a perfect connection on those devices. No stuttering or spotty connection.

Really great product for only $10.",5.0,2025-03-13,United State

For instance, gamers and professionals in tech-heavy ecosystems may benefit from upgrading to adapters supporting newer Bluetooth versions.

Conclusion:

Bluetooth 5.0 continues to deliver excellent value for everyday tasks and remains compatible with the vast majority of Bluetooth-enabled devices in 2024. However, users seeking top-tier security, minimal interference, or energy efficiency might consider transitioning to adapters with Bluetooth 5.3. For a general user, the TP-Link UB500 still holds up as a practical and affordable choice.",4.0,2024-11-20,United State
Brian W.,"Plugged into a LinuxCNC (debian12) system running XFCE(4) Desktop.  Installed bluetooth support via apt,  rebooted the system (probably not even necessary), and done.  Paired with, and connected to, a bluetooth audio receiver that drives the aux input to the stereo receiver I have in my shop.  Now, when I log into the linuxCNC machine, bluetooth connects automatically and the system audio is routed to the sound system!  Boom!  The specs from the manufacturer/seller say it is only windows compatible but that is a shortcoming of their knowledge of modern linux rather than a shortcoming of the device.  It is a realtek chip which is very much supported in the linux kernel these days.  They'd likely sell a lot more of these units if they listed it as linux compatible.",5.0,2025-03-12,United State

M. Ormandy,"I was about ready to return this thing, it took over a half an hour to get it working. I made sure I had no other BT devices installed in Windows 10, then inserted this device. Windows assigned a driver, and the device appeared to be functioning in device manager, but could not see any other BT devices to connect to in the bluetooth manager. I tried unplugging, plugging back in, restarts, etc. I eventually used my cell phone to read the QR code for the driver download, downloaded it on my phone, put the file on Onedrive, then downloaded the file from Onedrive on my PC. I then extracted the zip file contents, went into the folder ""\Realtek Bluetooth 5.3 Driver Software\RTBlueR_Windows_1051.1038.1040.0301.2023_F027_L\BT_Driver\Win10X64"", and ran the installer. (If you have an older 86 bit version of Windows use the folder Win10X86 installer instead)

The install was super slow and took several minutes on a fast computer. Eventually it finished and when I went to bluetooth manager devices began to show up after I hit the ""add a device"" plus sign.

I saw the comments on ""tin can audio"" which is interesting, because that's why I was replacing my old BT adapter, yet THIS adapter did not have that issue, sound quality is good. I'm thinking those with the audio issue need to follow my steps, and download / install the driver from the link.

William I. Dube,"If this review helps in any way Positive or Negative Please hit HELPFUL!!!  It will help encourage me to continue my real reviews of products I've purchased.

Pros:  $Priced under $25  / Synced fast to my phone/ Nice soft  tone on speakers while syncing to let you know BT is discoverable (Note if you don't want then just synch device before turning on your speaker system/ Small/ Blue light is a nice touch/ Comes with cable and power adapter

Cons:  BT is not new standard (That said I think new standard was designed for more than just audio and since this is purely audio system does not appear to be much of a limitation),  Cable provided works but if you want high end sound you need better connectors (will cost you maybe $10 to $20 on up depending on how high quality connectors you want to get for hoking to this system),  I can understand the power adapter, but since it is 5 volts and low amperage I think a USB cord option would be nice.  Lastly no battery powered option although it would not be hard to rig up to a power bank.

Okay... I've had this a day now and as you can guess I love this device.  The range for the Bluetooth is awesome in that I can bring my phone all over the house and not loose BT connection to my stereo.  Only thing I don't like about writing a review like this is that it also makes a good reason to raise the price..  Okay I guess with that said if the price gets above $27 for this great device I would look at my other options if I were to get some for friends.

UPDATE:  9/27/2018  Yes there was a lot of background noise at the beginning of my review as my neighbor is having an underground pool installed in his yard; it was not noise from this device.

Thank you for reading my review:

Again Please give this review a thumbs up.  It is real.  I've been on Amazon as a customer for over twenty years.  I don't get compensated for my reviews. (Not that I wouldn't like to be.)

Lek,"I am using this in my workshop at home to feed streaming music, like Amazon Music playlists, to my Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin 2 iPod player. It has the obsolete 30-pin iPod dock connector (thanks a lot Apple, yet another planned obsolescence â€œfeatureâ€) but is a truly excellent sounding machine. Not wanting to let it go yet, I tried a different Bluetooth adapter with the 30-pin connector and it did not work directly or via AUX input cable. It played and dropped out repetitively continuously. Maybe thatâ€™ the B&W digital sound not playing nice, but the AUX input SHOULD have worked. Well, this one seems more robust and not too intrusive. I like that it scan stay powered on, so I can just walk in and start sending music to it. I like the cable a lot: either twin RCA or AUX jacks, so you can just swap it around for either input into the player, speaker, stereo unitâ€¦ whatever. Versatile! Iâ€™m going to try reversing it to see if the sound quality improves. It sounds fine, but the Zeppelin is capable of truly open transparent sound. Sadly, its not simple to get to streaming digital uncompressed music. Amazon seems to compress it a lot.  At least, in my limited experience and investigations. I like the looks of the unit, and it is small and VERY light. One user said they stuck it down with some adhesive-backed velcro. Nice idea. I may do the same to some 1/16â€ micro-plywood and have the B&W Zepâ€™ sit on the wood and hold the BT unit in place.",5.0,2025-01-04,United State

Summer Sailor,"This is my first Amazon product review where there are not enough stars to give.  I'd give this BT adapter 6 if I could.  The Bluetooth connection for audio is maybe the best BT device I've every used.  If you've used Bluetooth before, you know pairing can be a hassle.  And when you disconnect and come back later, reconnecting sometimes takes extra effort.  Occasionally with some BT devices, the best remedy for connecting is to ""forget the device"" and then pair and reconect.  I'm mentioning all of this because of what I've experienced all too often with BT before --  and what I HAVE NOT experienced at all with this Esinkin BT audio adapter.  The BT connection is almost instant.  I never have any issues at all.  In fact, two people here have connected at once.  I have an older but excellent audio amplifier and this adapter easily connects to one of the audio inputs.  Then I effortlessly connect my smart phone, tablet or computer via esiinkiin Bluetooth to play songs and podcasts through my studio speakers.  I just hope it lasts forever.  I highly, highly recommend this product.",5.0,2025-03-01,United State
Robert Fitler,"I've bought 2 of these, over a year apart, since I gave my first one to my wife to use on an old Bose wave system.  This is a simple, small and flexible little adapter.  Note that it only works in one direction - It's designed specifically to allow using a Bluetooth device, like a cell phone with an audio device that doesn't support Bluetooth. I use the eSinkin to let me listen to my music collection from my iPhone on my old Pioneer receiver - It comes with a 3.5mm to RCA connector adapter cable that works perfectly to connect to the RCA jacks for Aux in.  You can reverse this cable and plug it into the RCA jacks on the adapter if your device has a 3.5mm jack for input, which is what I did with the one I gave my wife.

Audio quality is outstanding - certainly as good as my old stereo and speakers can reproduce.  Range is good as well - I can walk around the house with my phone and the audio still plays without interruption.

Others have noted that it is pretty determined to grab my phone's Bluetooth connection regardless of my desires, but I fixed that by plugging it into the 'switched' outlet on my receiver so it only comes on when I turn on the receiver.

I would whole-heartedly recommend the eSinkin Bluetooth adapter if you're looking to add Bluetooth to an older device.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0,2024-11-14,United State

D. Good,"We have an older home stereo system complete with CD player and all, but no Bluetooth capability.  I was looking for a way to add Bluetooth so I could use it to play music from my phone, and there are a lot of options to do so - at all sorts of price ranges.  This little gadget appeared to be a low cost solution, and it absolutely was.  It took longer for my wife to dust out the stereo cabinet than it did for me to connect this device and pair it with my phone.  Literally - a minute after I plugged this adapter in, I had it paired to my phone and was listening to music.  Painless!  And it was less than $30!  Now, I'm sure audiophiles could go on for hours about how a $400 adapter would sound so much better, and they might be right -- but this sounds just as good as listening to the CD player that's also plugged into my stereo, and I didn't have to dip into the kids college fund to buy it.  It comes with a 3.5mm to RCA plug cable, but I opted to buy an RCA to RCA audio cable instead since this has RCA audio out as well as a 3.5mm headphone style jack.  Also included was a proprietary USB cable so you can power it from a USB-A port, and an AC adapter so you can plug it into the wall.

For your MP3 player and or bluetooth devise they should be OK and work well for shorter runs Even a CD player should work well with shorter runs...Also they have to be better than generic non shield RCA cable that comes with many components... I have to try this cable out more...On first try connected  to the CD player and amp I thought I detected a very high frequency ring somewhere out in the  19 to 20 khz range...The ringing seems to have subsided but I still want to try some other things first before giving it an unqualified high praise recommendation....If I discover something unusual I will try and report back with the added information.

To my surprise this RCA cable is the most clear one and send stronger signal also less noise than all the other one(much beefy) that I bought ofcause I'm not saying this is the best cable in the world and I have no idea where to purchase them but this is good enough for me to swap them all out.

manchego,"The Primeda RCA cables are outstanding in every way. From the connectors to the cable itself, the build quality is exceptionalâ€”solid, durable, and visually impressive. For the price, they are an excellent value, especially when compared to higher-end brands.

But what about the sound? In my experience, they outperform Audioquest cables by a noticeable margin. The reason? These Primeda RCA cables feature a two-conductor design, which makes a huge difference in audio performance. Hereâ€™s why:

- Superior shielding: The second conductor acts as a shield, protecting the audio signal from interference like electromagnetic or radio-frequency noise. This results in a cleaner, purer sound.
- Reduced noise: With a dedicated ground and signal conductor, these cables significantly reduce any potential hum or noise, especially important for high-fidelity setups.
- Better channel separation: For stereo audio, the two-conductor design ensures better isolation between the left and right channels, giving you clearer and more distinct sound.

Overall, if youâ€™re looking for RCA cables that deliver both on quality and sound, the Primeda two-conductor RCA cables are the way to go. Highly recommended!",5.0,2024-09-16,United State

FriÃ°vin SamÃºelsson,"It is almost pointless writing a review of interconnect cables. Everyone has different equipment, various music preferences, and different listening habits.

And this is why Iâ€™m going to get wordy with this review as opposed to saying â€œIâ€™m happy with theseâ€ and knowing that really tells you nothing.

If your budget only allowed you to spend $200 or $300 on a music system you probably arenâ€™t looking at cables costing hundreds of dollars. If you spent $15,000 on a system you probably arenâ€™t looking at cables on Amazon at all.  Or maybe you are one of the people who thinks it doesnâ€™t matter â€” that there is not a noticeable difference between a $23 cable and a $230 cable.

For perspective, I spent several thousand on my system, and I am using it in an unused extra large bedroom I have set up for a dedicated music room.  I have my equipment on a wall and a comfy leather chair set up at just the right distance from the speakers for optimal sound.

You might have bookshelf speakers sitting on a desk or wall shelf. You might enjoy listening passively while working. I used CDs by Fiona Apple, Cassandra Wilson, and Pink Floyd to audition these cables. You may be into Black Flag and X, or 1940s jazz.

All of these things are factors in what you are going to hear and how you are going to hear it.

When I bought my system it was comprised of a turntable and CD player. And I bought Kimber Kables at $117 each.

A few years ago I decided to add a Bluesound streaming device and I used the cables connected to my CD to give it a test run and decided to keep the streamer. Since that time the CD player was sitting disconnected and unused. I decided I wanted to get it connected and running again and this is why I ordered these new cables.

I was very impressed and raving about what great value they are.  But me being me, I had to reconnect the pair of Kimbers just to compare. I started to have doubts about my purchase. It isnâ€™t because there is a huge difference in the sound.  It is actually a minuscule difference, if there is a difference at all.  Maybe the bell at the conclusion of a song just sounds a bit more crisp. Maybe the singerâ€™s voice sounds a bit closer to me. Maybe thereâ€™s just a little more depth in the soundstage.  MAYBE itâ€™s all in my head.

See how this works?

The only thing I can tell you with certainty is that these cables sound good.  Really good. And unless you have an audiophile system I cannot imagine why you might spend 10x more than you need to for audiophile cables. These are outstanding for the price.

And if you do have an audiophile system, and you enjoy sitting in a chair in front of music which makes you heave with emotion, Iâ€™d still suggest you compare these with whatever your higher-end choice is if you relish the thought of saving a few hundred bucks. Nothing can replace making a comparison yourself, in your environment, with the music you like.

Ultimately, I decided to order another pair of Kimber Kables simply because I donâ€™t want to deal with this doubt and testing each of the cables every time I play a different CD. This is the curse of being an audiophile.
Iâ€™ll just spend the extra $110 and be done with it, and get on with my life.

The cables have a nice feel coming out of the bag.  And the bag is a zip top so no worries about having to rip a bag open and then wondering if youâ€™ll get hassled about returns.

I am not going to bother returning them.  I would have no problem using them with the integrated amp I have set up with my television, just in case I decide to add a CD player there at a later time.",5.0,2023-09-14,United State
Stephen,"These are great brushes, wet or dry! I have three, one for dry cleaning and two for wet cleaning. I originally bought for dry cleaning. Then bought a record dr vacuum cleaner so I tried wet. Well, the pad came unglued right away. I had seen reviews mentioning that so not surprised. The next morning after dry, the pad stuck right back on. Itâ€™s not dissolving the glue, simply releasing it. Since itâ€™s made for wet cleaning, there appears to be a manufacturing issue. So, I grabbed a rubber band to keep the pad in place. Even without, the pad didnâ€™t slip of slide off of the rubber. I read another review that mentioned the replacement pads stayed glued when wet. I may order just to test. I will amend this review if I do.

Anyway, the band worked perfectly and I actually like the look. Plus, if I set down on the edge, it protects the pad from getting contaminated by any foreign objects that may be the surface. After I use for cleaning, I rinse with distilled water, press on a lint free cloth and the when dry, glue is sticking like new! Iâ€™m going to get another color rubber band so I can easily identify the two wet cleaning brushes, oneâ€™s for cleaner, the other for ultra pure water rinse. I use a different record doctor bristle type brush for the second cleaner in between. Itâ€™s a very effective combination!

As other reviews note, a few threads will fray at the ends. No big deal, I have a pair of scissors to snip them off. Donâ€™t pull them! After a few come loose, it stabilizes and rarely have to trim. Even with the glue and minor fraying, itâ€™s an awesome brush. So, donâ€™t send it back, get a rubber band and scissors and keep this little beauty. Hopefully they get the issues fixed in future production, but for now, I can deal with it just fine.",5.0,2021-03-06,United State
Marco,"I read the reviews for this item before purchasing and saw that some reviewers had quality control issues with it. My unit arrived in excellent shape and has stood up to about a month's worth of use with no signs of wear. The surface is a velvet like texture of very short bristles that really get into the grooves of the record. It will bring out a visible line of dust even when used after a conventional anti static brush or microfiber cloth.
One downside is that it will leave a line of dust where you stop on the record which can then be removed with anoth cloth or brush.
It also is good for applying disc cleaner or distilled water if you use it. I am considering purchasing a second one so as to have one each for wet and dry applications.",5.0,2021-03-24,United State
DR,"I suspect that this is the premiere vinyl cleaning brush of this type, and it's just fine. It gets points for that.

I've found myself just not using this one in favor of the Eveo one I bought, which is a little more pleasant to use.",4.0,2025-02-07,United State
LFW,Just received my MoFi record brush. I have used it wet with my Record Doctor VI. Iâ€™ve cleaned 5 records (both sides) so far and it has worked flawlessly and still looks like new. Iâ€™ve noticed less surface noise after using this as a wet brush with my Record Doctor VI.

If anything changes I will update this!,5.0,2024-10-25,United State
Bruschak,"I have a number of record cleaning brushes which provide acceptable results. However, when I saw that MoFi had a brush available, I gave it a try based on the overall quality of their products. This brush seems to clean more deeply and effectively than the carbon fiber (or similar) style brushes which are commonly used. It feels very solid and stable while cleaning. Dust removed from the record can be easily cleaned from the brush by brushing across most fabrics and the pads can be replaced as needed. The brush does not seem to generate anymore static than the &#34;anti-static&#34; carbon fiber brush styles. One downside; it puts a lot of drag on the record while spinning, so Id suggest using a light touch to prevent stretching a belt drive. Overall, highly recommended.",5.0,2017-01-17,United State

grooveman,"If you are patient, you can get good results with this.  Using a good quality record cleaning fluid like L'art Duson or AIVS or somethign similar, and just fllow the grooves.  The felt seems to track into them nicely, and get surprisingly deep.  I've even had luck on removing old, stubborn finger prints from some records (which I have found to be the hardest thing to remove when they get to be 40+ years old).+

The only con is that these do wear out... You can probably use it 20 times, then it seems to be done.  I heard a rumor that the felts are replaceable... if that is true, that is a tremendous plus... I just haven't found them anywhere yet (though I havne't looked very hard).",4.0,2025-02-16,United State
JAQ2Cents,"I used this on a brand new record since I'm now convinced of the obvious reality that every new sealed recent release needs to be wet cleaned as before you drag a stylus through the grooves. Even lacquers from outstanding plants spill some black plastic curlycue shavings out of the sleeve with new discs. This won't require fine synthetic felt hairs to deep clean the grooves, but your attention should quickly be drawn to the other visible and non-visable debris that get sealed with discs pressed or cut at even the most reputable plants. There's no point cutting or pressing records in clean rooms, but there's also a reason that Mofi wet vacs their MFSL special releases (there's pretty clear evidence of this on the records) and I wouldn't doubt they use this tool or the same felt/synthetic velvet to spread cleaning solutions and rinses on every on of them.

I'm pretty sure I'll be picking up another one of these very soon. I've been questioning my &#34;cart alignment game&#34; after trying to get it down for over a year now. The reason for this is because some of my vinyl still has some hiss that I suspected to be drag from imperfect alignment. I'm no longer underconfident about that. As I sit here listening to Sharon Van Etten's 2012 EP &#34;Tramp&#34; there is no hiss. Nothing. Totally black. CD/digital esque quietude. Deeper, more open sound as good as any MFSL release or well mastered 45 rpm tracks suspended in total deafening silence.

These shoes are super cute, comfortable, were a great price, donâ€™t make my feet look huge, and fit well.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I struggle with the shoe pulling my socks down when I walk.  I wear ankle/no show socks and it doesnâ€™t take long before my socks are below my heel.  After having worn them a few times and making sure they are tied tight enough, it has gotten better.

Ryan K,"This stuff is my go to record cleaning fluid. It is really gentle on the vinyl, but still manages to attract a lot of dust and other debris and particulates you wanna get out of your record's grooves. Also just wanna say even if you listen to your records a lot, and use cleaning fluid with every spin- this bottle will last you a good long while. Got my last refill 3 months ago and am about half or 3/8 full of fluid still. So I'd say at the absolute least, with maximum record spinning and cleaning, one bottle will safely last about 4.5 to 6 months. Which is damn good value considering ""cheaper"" cleaning fluids in smaller quantities will in that same amount of time end up costing quite a bit more. I would recommend you stock up on one of these and keep a smaller spray bottle for everyday use, they even give you a drip nozzle for easy refills! It'll be there for you for a while and it'll make your records sound so much nicer than they would without a good and powerful but not too abrasive cleaning fluid.",5.0,2023-01-26,United State

They have proven that customer service is a big priority and they listen to their customers criticism about the products they sell.  I will definitely buy from them again. Five stars for fixing the issues and improving the final product.

This cleaner was awful.  Following every direction the cleaner left residue in the grooves of the record.  My record stylus picked up so much residue that flaked up like dust that I couldn't play half of a record without cleaning the stylus.  None of my other cleaners from the competitors have had this problem.  I have bought many other boundless products and the quality was always great.

Caitlyn,"I carry backpacks in place of purses because it frees up my hands for handling my service dog. The last backpack I bought from Amazon was poorly made and the straps fell off after only a few months. This one already feels far more sturdy and I will update this review if/when it gives out.

Good things: I love the cute chevron/zigzag embossed design on the front. The main compartment zipper pull is wide because it latches to a mount when zipped close, but the unexpected bonus of that wide zipper pull is that it is more arthritis-friendly. My fingers appreciate that. The front zippered pocket has a cute tassel decoration on the zipper pull. The extra hardware from the tassel attachment gave me plenty of space to clip my ""EpiPen Inside"" tag to. The front pocket is flat and doesn't expand, so it doesn't hold much. For me, it perfectly fits 2 EpiPens and the practice pen. Anything else put in there will obstruct the ability to completely zip it closed. This is not a negative for me because I always put just my EpiPens in the front small pocket of my backpacks, but if you're wanting to put extra stuff in it, keep in mind the pocket will not expand. The faux leather feels sturdy, yet is also soft to the touch. The straps are wide enough to not dig into your shoulders but not so wide that they look disproportionate to the bag. All hardware accents are gold colored. The straps seem securely stitched, but time will tell.

Indifferent things: The zippered pocket on the backside of the backpack has a pretty deep pocket, about 6 inches deep, but my rectangular frame wallet doesn't fit in it. The main compartment only has one small zippered pocket.

Bad things: the orange is not quite as bright ans vivd as it is in the listing images. I keep my phone screen very dimmed and it still looks brighter on Amazon than in person. That having been said, the color is still beautiful, just not the bright orange I eas expecting. I live in Knoxville, TN, the realm of the University of Tennessee Volunteers. It's all orange everything around here, and now my backpack is no exception, even if it isn't the right shade of orange.

Weird things: the brand tag inside the bag is chunky with something hard stitched inside it. Where the last T in MONTANA WEST should be on the main compartment zipper pull, there us a little indentation of a T without the black enamel filling. Upon further inspection, I found the black enamel T stuck to the bag elsewhere. It easily brushed off. I included photos of this.

Overall, nothing was a deal breaker. The backpack is cute and holds everything I need.",5.0,2023-05-07,United State

Steff,"I was looking for a mini backpack that wouldn't be too small but a backpack that wouldn't be super big that could hold quite a bit of stuff for an outing for one of my kids is school trips. And I came across this one. The material is buttery soft I don't know if it is actual weather but it feels really close to being leather. It's nice because it has a smaller bag that can carry on your shoulder or carry that as a cross bag. I end up using that one to carry all the things that I need that I don't want to fall to the bottom of the bag and I can get to that bag and just put them in and it fits right in it does take up more space so you can carry the smaller bag is a crossbody as you carry the mini backpack I did that a few times during the trip but mostly all in all I just had it inside the mini backpack and it fit. Then you have a smaller bag that I guess you would carry your lights cosmetics or you can carry your change and your cards or whatever you need. I carried small essentials that I would need to get out like Band-Aids, ointment and other things if I needed it for the kiddos while on this trip and also for myself. I prefer more padded straps but these straps are so soft that I several times forgot that I was even wearing the backpack unless I lean back feeling the weight in the bag which with anything you over pack it, it's going to feel super heavy, but it was comfortable there and had so many pockets so I could put my cell phone in and get to it. It doesn't have side pockets on the two sides but the pocket with the clasp and zipper is where I ended up putting my phone and my phone charger and the electronics that I needed to reach quickly. Again I really loved the soft material it's on the straps the bag everything it's really soft and comfortable. It has four zipper pockets and total on the bag. The big main zipper or you can turn to clasp it close. Inside the Big bang zipper is a smaller back zipper pocket. The second zipper pocket slot, and then the front zipper pocket that also has a flap over clasp to it. What I like about the main zipper is there's a twist lock on it and that's nice to feature to have so my bag can stay closed and it's not something to be easily opened, I just thought that was a really neat cool feature. I wish they would have put this feature for the second zipper opening after the big mean zipper, just I guess my personal opinion but it would have been a good feature to have had on for the backpack bag. It doesn't make the bag any less unfunctional or bad in any way but that's an option I would give to the company that makes the bags that they should put that twist mechanism on the second zipper pocket. Just something to think about. So far for me the bag has been really good I'm glad I purchased it. I haven't found any downside or anything bad to say about it, it's been a good bag and it worked perfectly for the trip I needed to go on. I'm still using it and I really like it! I love it!!

The material is soft. Iâ€™m not sure about the quality and security of the RFID blocking because, I havenâ€™t had any issues, thankfully. Iâ€™m sure it works as it should though. I absolutely love this wallet and it was worth the money. I will probably purchase again in another color.",5.0,2024-09-14,United State
Lisa,"I searched high and lo to replace my previous wallet that lasted ten years and was no longer available. After many disappointments, I finally came to this one. Itâ€™s actually perfect for me because I donâ€™t carry a lot of cards at all. Everything I need fits just right. I took one star away because I really donâ€™t like the raised logo on the front of the wallet (a company has right to brand their product, but a hard plastic, raised logo is just annoying in my hand). Iâ€™m also a little sad about the color choices. I like something different so between the purple and green I went with green. Itâ€™s quite a muted color and can be ugly in some lighting. But because I searched so, so long to find this kind of wallet, Iâ€™m making peace with it. Itâ€™s well made, the zipper hasnâ€™t given me any grief at all, it doesnâ€™t weigh a ton and works without hassle. I can get in an out of it easily and the snap opens and closes without issue. At this price point, itâ€™s worth every penny. My only request to the company would be to make better color options.",4.0,2024-05-30,United State
Jade,"This wallet has so many pockets to it
 12 actual slots for cards or ID's, 3 pockets inside the wallet, and then the zipper pocket which I use as the coin purse. My only problem is the slot where you would want to put your ID is to tight to remove an ID as often as you would need to. Since that's a minor problem I still think this wallet is amazing.",5.0,2025-02-23,United State
Brittney,It's perfect for when you don't really want to bring a lot of stuff with you. It can hold 12 card.

The color is exactly as shown.,5.0,2025-01-12,United State
Cassie,"I liked the color of this item and the RFID protection, but the pockets for credit cards are very tight so getting cards in and out is difficult. The coin zipper can't really hold coins - the flap that seperates items in the zipper compartment isn't completely attached to the bottom so coins slip around back and forth under the flap in the coin pocket. Also the seperator in the coin area isn't as tall as the zipper area so coins slip out and collect on the side of the compartment if the wallet is tipped in any way, thus when unzipping the coin section your coins fall to the ground.",3.0,2025-02-01,United State

That being said the purse was a bit smaller than I anticipated. It's tall enough however I thought it was going to be more wide. Could use another 4 inches in length.

The strap is solid & adjusts easily & quite long if need be.

The pockets are a bit small bit I like that they're tight. Holds in my cards or chapstick better if my purse dumps over.

All in all it's a fantastic purse especially for those like myself that prefer smaller messenger style bags",4.0,2024-07-30,United State

IS3,"I really liked the look of the BODY of this bag so I kept it and planned on replacing the clashing, tacky, cheap looking strap. Finding a strap that would ""go"" without necessarily ""matching"" has been too difficult for what it's worth, so I ended up settling on another strap I already had.  On top of that, the bag has a stiff, cheap feel to it. Given the overall bother, I should have just returned the thing. I gave it three stars because I do like the overall design & color play of the bag portion. Too bad they got so cheap with the strap and didn't just make one of the same material so that it actually matched.",3.0,2025-01-14,United State

Anna,"Let me start off by saying that for $18, this wallet is great. It holds a million cards and I love the full size money pouch so my bills can lay out flat instead of being scrunched up like in most wallets. Itâ€™s sleek and feels sturdy quality. My only (and I would say big) complaint is that the ID pocket is TERRIBLE. I put my license in the mesh pocket thinking nothing of it but when I went to take it out, it took me 20 minutes to wedge it out of the pocket. There is no thumb hole in the mesh to slide it out and the top stitching for the pocket doesnâ€™t allow the card to slide out easily (it gets caught on the stitching). Definitely not putting my ID in that pocket again lol. The good news is there are plenty of other card pockets to choose from! I just wish the ID pocket was fixed so itâ€™s functional.

Alyssa,"Love the color (probably not for everyone), but the bag itself is amazing for the price. I was a bit nervous the straps wouldnâ€™t be too sturdy, but this bag has held 2 MacBooks, a very heavy portable charger, and numerous other items (like everything else shown in the inside photo), and there have been no issues whatsoever. I probably wouldnâ€™t recommend walking around with that much in it for an extended period, but Iâ€™ve walked at least 20 minutes straight with 1 MacBook in there and all was fine. The straps are pretty stiff, so may not be the most comfortable for everyone.

Zippers have kept up, and while I do love the bag and itâ€™s versatility, I wish the back part with the pocket was the front of this bag, and that the back was something else (not a huge fan of the dark bradided pieces on the front side).

I think the listing has a mixture of this size and the smaller size, pending what color youâ€™re after. Make sure you pick the right size, the other one looks MUCH tinier",5.0,2025-03-08,United State

GG,"Bought these to clean a quantity of albums that had been sitting for several years. Many were probably not real clean when put away. What worked for me: With a spritz or 2 of cleaner, these cloths really did a nice job, I used the cloths folded so as not to touch the vinyl with the edge stitching, No reason other than thread didn't seem as soft. Records came out looking very nice and black, and played very quiet. MY METHOD: Cover the label. Don't soak the record, mist it. Hang the towel up to dry, before its' saturated and use another. I have room to set six albums aside on-edge to dry, then I clean one and put the first one in its' jacket and cover, etc. Be sure you use liquid formulated for what your records are made of.

M,"I used the try at home to order a box of jeans and get a good fit. These look OK and fit OK when I first put them on, but as the day wears on, they stretch out. The fabric is thicker than I like for jeans. The boot cut for the normal length is very long, has too much flare, and has a lot of fabric at the bottom, more than the picture appears.  Therefore they look bunchy when i roll them up a bit, which is what i usually do with jeans, since I am too tall for a short length and not quite tall enough for a regular length.

However, the hem of the bottom near the ankles was so destroyed that it looked like a puppy got a hold of my jeans and would not let go. I am not a fan of that particular look on me, so unfortunately, I will be returning them. If I were to cuff them, I would have to cough them two times Which would make them much higher than the look I was going for.

Sheena Warling,Iâ€™m in love with these jeans. I have now bought 3 of the dark wash distressed and 3 of the acid wash/faded blue distressed. The photo is the dark wash. I usually buy a size 13 in juniors. Iâ€™m a size 12 normally in womenâ€™s. I could probably fit a size 10 but I donâ€™t like my clothes tight. So the dark wash Iâ€™ve noticed are looser/maybe just stretchier. So my first order I got both in 13â€™s. Second time around I bought 11â€™s in the dark wash and 13 in the lighter. Wearing these nearly everyday (which is why I bought more lol) It just hit below triple digits in South Texas and wasnâ€™t sure if I could wear these without melting. I joked with my husband that the distressed holes were perfect ventilation. I felt nearly as cool as I would in shorts. The legs are a little wider along with stretchy.. but thatâ€™s perfect since I have a more athletic/thicker build in my legs. Might be loose  if you have thinner legs.,5.0,2023-09-20,United State

Beth Merrill-Bauer,"I had a beloved chenille sweater for years that had become so thread-bare, I knew it was time to throw it out & try to find a new one. Since it was Amazon Prime Days, I decided to see what Amazon might have. I found this gorgeous sweater & knew I had to get it. It comes is a number of really nice colors; since Autumn colors are my favorite, I ordered this golden orange color right away. Even without the Prime Days discount, the sweater cost is exceptionally good. When the sweater arrived, I was immediately taken by how thick & warm the material felt. Decided to wear this sweater yesterday since the mornings have gotten rather chilly here in Anchorage, Alaska this week. The sweater was a soft & warm as it felt from the outside yet breathed enough that I never felt overheated even moving into & out of several shopping areas & stores. I loved that the sleeves weren't excessively long but the sweater body was long enough to cover my bum. The fit (I got 2X) was really nice. I have to order a plus size top due to my bust size but, too often, I find the fit to be poor. Not in this case! I remained cozy warm & comfortable all day & late into the night while I worked on my SVG designs & holiday gifts for family & friends. My only regret? I didn't buy one in each of the colors!! This sweater would easily transition from a dressed up work sweater (with leggings, boots, & some awesome jewelry) to post-work day family time or errand running. So, buy one -- NO, buy TWO or more!",5.0,2024-10-23,United State

A. Hamilton,"When I opened the package I immediately smelled the familiar laundry detergent aroma.  I am highly sensitive to chemical smells so I know the stink of laundry soap residue.  I paid for what I assumed was a brand new sweater, but it is not. It will take multiple washings to get that stink out.  Very annoying!

The sweater itself seems very soft and I agree with other reviews that it does run small.  I love the style and color so I'm keeping it, but buyer beware that you might get a used product and pay new price.

Customer Review,"Simple&Opulence Women's Chenille Sweater Drawstring Hooded Long Sleeve Pullover Ribbed Cuff Hem Jumper Tops

This is a lovely chenille hoodie. Itâ€™s polyester. Itâ€™s soft and warm with a gorgeous sheen.

Itâ€™s lightweight yet substantial at the same time. The hood is fantastic and the strings are so nice with metal caps.

The red is rich. The size is true to size however I went up a size for a better shoulder fit. This sweater is gorgeous with jeans, slacks and joggers. Iâ€™ve worn a blazer over it with the hood pulled out. Itâ€™s a more elevated casual look when worn this way.

Itâ€™s a great value.

Mr.Papillon,"I have feet that fit normally in regular shoes easily, never had to buy wide but Iâ€™ve been trying to give my toes room to splay for my foot health recently. Have had multiple barefoot shoes before this with no issues. I didnâ€™t heed the other reviews saying these were a little narrow because theyâ€™re advertised as wide toe box and I donâ€™t have particularly wide feet so I thought theyâ€™d be fine. BUT they are really really narrow! Do not buy these unless you actually have really narrow feet and want the zero drop. Also I have medium high foot volume and feel too much pressure on the top of my foot as well. Iâ€™m extra sad because these seem to have really high quality construction and I was really positive about them until I wore them for a while and felt the pinch. Ouch!",1.0,2025-01-06,United State
Beth,"I enjoy the color and the feel of these shoes. I ordered 8.5 womenâ€™s size as that is the same size as the Prio Suede pair I own and found the fit similarly.

I had an issue with the inner heel of the prio suede style wearing thin quickly from the inside within the first month of wear. The company responded that everyone wears their shoes a bit differently so the wear would be different for everyone. Based on their response to my previous issue I will have to wait and see whether or not the fuzz Iâ€™m seeing on the front of these shoes, after a few days of wearing them, will amount to holes in the near future.

These shoes are more breathable than the Prio Suede but still quite warm in the midsole and heel of the shoe, likely because despite the mesh appearance, the midsole and heel have quite a bit of padding to offer stability.

I have yet to see this brand living up to its cost. If I find this pair canâ€™t hold up for even a few months I would rank the quality as low as any random shoe from Ross Dress for Less.",3.0,2024-05-27,United State

Happy cyclist,"I enjoy Xero's sandals, especially the thin & flexible Aqua Cloud, so was hoping this closed-toe shoe would be similarly flexible.

Polly W,"The design on these shoes is amazing!

I have not noticed any slipperiness and they are fairly easy to walk around in. I always wear socks with mine, and I do not walk particularly long distances, however. I am not sure that I would recommend doing this â€“ walking long distances or walking in these for hours on end. I can also see how if by some chance you chose to run in them, these Crocs would possibly not hold up well, or could hurt your feet.

I believe, based off what I read â€“ and based off what I have seen â€“ as having been what Crocs were initially used for (boating shoes?), that they would not make good athletic shoes.

The sizing is perfect for me. I wear a size 9.5 in sneakers. But with the Classic Crocs, I chose to size up. This leaves plenty of extra space for my feet, but not so much that there is a fall risk.

Many might find if they wear half sizes that it is helpful to size down instead. But sizing up led to my Crocs being more comfortable for me personally, overall. I have average-sized feet.

They arenâ€™t super wide or narrow, and purchasing Crocs cuts down on foot pain and such. I should add that I suffered a foot injury a couple months back, which I am not fully recovered from. These shoes are heavenly compared with most shoes I have worn.

Normally, when outdoors for only a few minutes in my other shoes that are not Crocs, I experience some foot pain or discomfort immediately after. This has not been my personal experience with Crocs. Although these particular ones may be slightly less durable than another pair I own, the Stomps.

I am absolutely bananas for Crocs!
Lol.

J. Obrien,"If you have never worn Crocs you are missing a wonderful experience.  I wore Croc for years as they were great for a variety of activities, indoor and outdoors.  I gave up my last pair several years ago due to fair wear of the crocs.  i wore them everywhere, indoors and outdoors.  Comfortable and can wear with or without light socks.  I prefer without socks!
I realized this past month that I really missed having Crocs to wear around the house instead of slippers.  Crocs last a lot longer than slippers!  They may not be as cozy as slippers but wearing them with socks for warmth in the Winter is totally acceptable.  Thank you Amazon for selling this great product in my favorite color of PURPLE, they arrived today and I love them. They are great year round and last a lot longer than slippers even outside!!!",5.0,2025-03-09,United State

âœ” Versatile & Easy to Wear â€“ Slip them on and go! Theyâ€™re perfect for every occasionâ€”be it at home, the beach, or a casual outing.

Nassyâ€™s Corner,Comfortable yet stylish Crocs. This is quality for your money the material thick and durable. True to size,5.0,2025-03-17,United State
Lacie,"SIZING + FIT: 1) I wear an exact womenâ€™s size 8.5. Sometimes size 9 so I can add a Dr Scholl arch insole.  I ordered these Crocs in two different sizes so I could try them and return the size that didnâ€™t work. The size womenâ€™s 9 was too large/loose. The size womenâ€™s 8 fit me best, but not perfect.  2) The right shoe is somewhat larger & looser than the left, and the heel strap is longer.  3) I tried inserting a Dr Scholl insole in these Crocs. It did make the shoes more snug on my feet, and added arch support.  The insoles stayed in place.  But, it just felt wrong to put an insole in a Croc shoe since I bought these for orthopedic comfort & support, so I removed them.  4) My husband also just ordered these exact Crocs from Amazon in size Men's 11.  He normally wears a size 10.5 or 11 shoe. They fit him okay, but they are somewhat loose on his narrow feet and he ends up walking duck-footed, with his toes pointed outward, to keep them from slipping.

COMFORT: 1) After reading A LOT of reviews, I concluded that the comfort of Crocs are unique to each person. People with wider feet seem to really love them. People with foot or back problems love them. People with narrower feet arenâ€™t usually impressed by them.  2) I sit & stand at my desk all day and these shoes are more comfortable than flip flops, but not as comfortable as high quality sneakers.  3) I have high arches and these shoes are tolerable, but donâ€™t really offer much arch support.  Perhaps my feet will eventually mold to the rubber â€“ time will tell.  4) These Crocs have a slight cushioned insole. They are not hard plastic, and the insole has a little bit of cushy give when I take a step.  5) When wearing these shoes for extended periods, I notice pain in the ball of my feet - metatarsals.  6) The little nubs inside these shoes are soft enough that they donâ€™t bother me or hurt my feet. That says a lot because I have very sensitive feet!  7) I find these shoes to be more comfortable and slip less when I wear them with socks.  8) I have a knock-off brand of Crocs with removeable orthopedic insoles. Those were initially comfortable on my feet, but the longer I wore them the more my feet hurt. The knock-off brand cost MORE than these Crocs ($33 vs $26).

LOOKS + COLOR: 1) Well, what can I really say here except I really didnâ€™t buy these for looks. They look like wide orthopedic shoes.  Oh yeah, thatâ€™s because they are!  Comfort overruled style in my case.  2) I bought some cute white flower charms on Amazon and that made my Crocs look more feminine and added a little something that was needed.  3) I ordered these in the color CHOCOLATE because I wanted a neutral color that didnâ€™t draw attention to my huge orthopedic shoes. In the listing photo they look kind of sparkly, but they arenâ€™t. They are a light, soft brown, almost a taupe color.  Later, IF this shoe style grows on me (remember, Iâ€™m a newbie Crock wearer) I may try some other fun colors like pink or red.

OTHER + GOOD TO KNOW + TIPS:  1) As other reviewers mention, these shoes squeak as you walk. Each step is â€œsqueak, squeak, squeakâ€¦â€.  2) In my opinion, Crocs are not ideal for narrow feet like mine. The shoes feel loose and I had them slip off while walking, which could be hazardous. I would not walk in these shoes for long distances or on uneven ground or on steps.  3) I heard that Crocs can be loosened or tightened using a blow dryer or in a clothes dryer.  I tried to tighten mine using a blow dryer on high heat, held 6 inches away, then let cool.  I was hoping the material would slightly shrink, especially the heel strap which is too loose.  Unfortunately, this heat method did not work for me. *If you try this, USE CAUTION so you don't ruin your shoes!  4) I read many reviews where people said their Crocs shrunk or warped when left out in the sun or in a hot vehicle , so keep that in mind.  5) The holes in the plastic help ventilate enough that my feet donâ€™t get super hot. Yes, my feet sweat a little in these shoes. There is a slight foot odor when wearing without socks. That is to be expected with rubber shoes.  6) I prefer to wear these shoes with socks because it helps with sweating and my feet donâ€™t slip as much.  7) The tag on these shoes says Made in China. The bottom of the shoe is imprinted with Made in China. They have a tag that warns about riding on escalators and holding childrenâ€™s hands at all times. I would never wear these on an escalator, but there must be some reason they include this tag â€“ probably because of known issues of the rubber soles getting stuck on escalators.  8) I have no idea if these are â€œauthenticâ€ Crocs because this is my first pair and I have nothing to compare to.  I checked the official Crocsâ€™ website and the shoes I received from Amazon look exactly like those on Crocsâ€™ website.  9) At the time of this review, I paid $26 for these Crocs on Amazon.  This same style on the official Crocsâ€™ website is priced much higher at $49. Amazon offers a lot more color options than Crocsâ€™ website.  10) I found where Amazon sells a slightly different style of Croc brand shoes that I might try â€œCrocs Unisex-Adult All Terrain Clogs with Adjustable Heel Strapâ€.  The adjustable heel strap may help in keeping my feet from sliding around. That style is a lot pricier at $41.

IN CONCLUSION: As a newbie Croc wearer, I am not totally convinced these shoes live up to all the hype and amazing reviews I read.  Like I said, I donâ€™t think these are ideal for my narrow feet. I donâ€™t feel safe wearing these outside my house because my feet slip in them so much.  I will most likely wear these inside my house, inside my RV or around the campsite.  PS- I am really disappointed that these didnâ€™t meet all my expectations, and I am envious of all the people who rave about these shoes.

I paid full price for these Crocs and was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope you found it helpful.",4.0,2023-08-17,United State

Ancient Search,"I am heartbroken.  The strap on my Crocs just broke and I am here to order another pair.  I should disclose that I bought this pair Sept. 26, 2018, and have worn them every. single. day. since then.  I slip into them first thing in the morning and comfortably go about my day after that.  I don't have to think about them.  They protect my aging feet from alkaline soil, all sorts of prickly things in our high desert environment, rocks, and over-exuberant puppies. They are equally at home watering the garden, potting up plants, chasing chickens and grandchild, and puttering around in the kitchen.  They are an integral part of everyday life, but, really.....shouldn't they last as long as I do?  I would have given them an eleven star rating, but this site must have foreseen my distress with the broken strap and I can only give them a 5.  My 3 year old grandchild calls them ""Nana's shoes"" and has a pair just like them that she adores.  In fact, I took a good look at my Crocs to be absolutely sure I ordered the exact same ones and noticed that mine, like me I might add, were showing their age quite a bit.  There is little or no tread left on the sole.  I guess the many trips around our acreage, up and down the road, mile after mile, for over 2500 days will do that to a shoe.  The inner sole has been worn smooth as well.  And there is that broken strap... You know, it's not even the actual strap... it's the little button thing that attaches the strap to the shoe.  Well, in any event, it's clearly time for a new pair.  May this pair be a part of many new adventures!",5.0,2025-01-23,United State

P,"**CAUTION** PLEASE READ...these mocks just arrived , during close inspection (while handling) I notice this odd reflective powdery coating inside the shoe , mostly on the removable insole. It had a sparkly odd irradescent substance in the shoes upon arrival??

Amber,"Back in April, I did something stupid. My hands were full and the door that I needed to get through was 1) heavy and 2) not automated. In a rush, I braced myself and flung the door inward and open, a lot harder than I meant to, catching my left big toenail with the door along the way. The entire previously-perfectly-healthy nail came off cleanly in 1 solid piece. Honestly, it could have been a lot worse, but I still wouldn't recommend it.

After 2 weeks of ointment and bandaging, the doctor said that the nailbed had healed up enough that I no longer needed to keep it bandaged. Yay! Having learned nothing from the accident itself, I'd continued wearing sandals for those 2 weeks and intended to keep wearing them...except that the nailbed area was still pretty wonky looking and scabbed over in one area. More than the appearance itself, I was concerned about dust, dirt, and other detritus working its way into some of the harder-to-clean crevices around the scabbed over area when I went for my daily lunchtime walk. I thought these might be a longer-lasting and less noticeable alternative to bandages...

...but they weren't. Yea, long story short, missing a toenail entirely, wearing one of these gel toe protectors over the affected toe, in sandals, didn't work out for walks. Sure, it kept the area clean, but it slipped constantly, gradually working its way up my toe, so that I'd have to stop and pull it back on. Obviously it got dirty, but it would only take a few days of wear before washing them off proved largely ineffective. Initially, the outside had a faintly flocked, velvety sort of texture to it, but daily washings did away with that in under a week, leaving behind a sticky, gummy surface that dust and dirt clung to horribly.

I don't know, maybe I was asking too much of these things. But if you're looking for something to solve the same sort of problem, I'd suggest sticking with bandages for a bit longer.",3.0,2024-12-10,United State

Max Yogi SR,"jury is out, these supports say they are 220lbs plus,,, that may well be true,,,
bc I am around 200, i say this bc, these guys have a hardshell arch support that is quite rigid,
now my shoes, which are keen hikers, with low ankle support, well they already have a arch shape
support to the shoe sole itself,,, so i am thinking,,, now i have TWO arch supports???
reason is, you definitely feel the arch support, it kinda changed the shoe, so on the first day,
the support feels significant, maybe like more than i want, the 2nd day, maybe the support pushing
into my arch felt a bit LESS pronounced.... I mean, it was a comfortable shoe with before , but the insole
was worn down after a couple of years...

Beck Trahan,"I gotta say that these insoles are the best. For me at least. When I realized I needed insoles to help with my back pain and high arches, I did a Google search and these came up first. Not ever hearing of the brand, I passed and went through three different brands with no relief. I was just about to try one of the high dollar insoles where you send them the form of your feet and they send you a custom pair. I figured before I paid the 100s of dollars on those, I'd give these a try. Especially since every time I did a search, these came up. Fast forward several months and I'm still using them pain-free and they are still helping me walk straight. And I have them in my steel toed boots wearing them all day at work and not kicking them off until I'm done with my honey-dos at home without any issues. Definitely recommend.

Ashley Jaggers,"I put a 4 star for now because I havenâ€™t used them for work yet but what I can say is instant relief! I bought a pair of Walmart work shoes with hard soles for durability not realizing that the pair I bought are the worst ones to have on my feet, so fast forward to now I had to use them again for a new job and by the following week my feet ached so bad I couldnâ€™t take it anymore, felt like I was walking on concrete barefooted.
It was either play Russian roulette on a pair of shoes I didnâ€™t know was going to work or get insoles and invest. I invested! These insoles gave me the biggest smile on my face right now, not only are they are comfortable they are durable! You can see the arch to where it curves to my foot. (Iâ€™m flat footed plus overweight so my poor feet were dying). Been in the restaurant business for 15 plus years. And I can already tell Iâ€™m gonna feel like Iâ€™m walking on a cloud!
Con: itâ€™s a con but it still worked in my favor. I accidentally ordered the wrong size insole. Meant to order a 8.5 womenâ€™s but accidentally ordered a 8.5 menâ€™s/10.5 womenâ€™s. And I compared my old insole to this one and it was the same size and when I put it in my work shoe it fit like a glove, so I guess the upside I didnâ€™t have to return it but to anyone that needs their exact size be aware.

Jackie Mullins,"My podiatrist recommended that I get some insoles with arch support to help keep weight off my heels because I have plantar fasciitis and I have spurs on both of my heels. I work 5 days a week and 10 hours a day and get well over 20,000 steps everyday for the most part. The pain was so horrible that I could barely walk and was in tears everyday so I went back to the doctor for steroid shots in my heels so I could walk and thatâ€™s when he recommended these. I give them 10 stars! We are out for spring break and donâ€™t go back for a week so they will really get put to the test next week but, as for now they do lift up my arches and keeps a lot of pressure off my heels. They donâ€™t slip in my shoes or have a bad smell like some do. I definitely recommend these!",5.0,2025-03-12,United State
Ken Lan,"These insoles deliver serious support for those of us over 200 pounds or with wider feet. The reinforced arch support maintains its shape impressively well, while the deep heel cup effectively distributes weight across the entire foot. I've found they work equally well in both work boots and regular shoes, providing noticeable shock absorption on hard surfaces.

The trim-to-fit design is straightforward, though take care to cut gradually. While they're thicker than standard insoles (you'll likely need to remove your original inserts), the firmness is ideal for proper support without sacrificing comfort. They excel at reducing fatigue during long days of standing or walking.

Two minor points to consider: They do take up more space in shoes than typical insoles, so expect a snugger fit. Also, they prioritize support over cushioning, which is actually better for long-term comfort and stability.

For big & tall individuals or those needing serious foot support, these insoles are a worthwhile investment. They're particularly valuable for wide feet or demanding work environments. The durability and enhanced weight distribution can even help extend the life of your footwear. At this price point, they offer professional-grade support that makes a real difference in daily comfort.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹",5.0,2025-01-22,United State

Supportive they are, cradling the heel like the wisdom of the Force. Relief they provideâ€”foot, knee, and back pain, vanquished almost immediately. Durable and strong, they extend the life of boots still worthy. Saved me, they have, from purchasing new, expensive work bootsâ€”for now.

Size 14, I wear, and perfectly they fit. But worry notâ€”size guides they have, allowing them to be trimmed down to a menâ€™s size 8. No squeaking, I hear, as others have mentioned. How long they shall last, time will tell.

A wise choice, this is. Comfort and endurance, yours shall be.",5.0,2025-03-01,United State
Benjamen,"Iâ€™ve tried a lot of insoles. The quality has berries big time. These ones in particular are my favorite and the only ones I buy as of 3-1-25.

They offer pain relief for my back. They are very stable. I put them in my winter slippers when the insoles feltâ€¦ just bad. They improved those slips hugely and I love them now. I also put these in my whether go-walks when those insoles went out. Fit perfectly after you cut them up. I also use them in my work boots and thereâ€™s a huge difference between the ones i got in my timbaland boots. Which I loved those boots before these insoles were put into them.

Iâ€™ll say the downside is the cutting. Itâ€™s hard to get it just right for you. Luckily my step daughter is great with scissors. lol

Wookieecantina,"While these are not the thickest insoles, for the price they work very well and I'm very pleased with them, I would count on replacing them approx. every four months if you're walking quite a bit, but again, for the price, they're certainly worth it. On the downside, they 'pop' when you walk. Super annoying, you sound like a cartoon heading down Main St. Disneyland.
NOTE TO MANUFACTURER:
The foam insert used on the heal has an extremely tacky formula. After being worn a very short while, this pad begins to stick to the to the interior sole of the shoe, at least shoes with a leather insole.
This should be changed to perhaps a different yet still soft, reflexive formula, perhaps a higher quality gel.
Wearing these insoles is literally embarrassing, being almost comical. 'Pop', 'Pop', 'Pop', lets go for a walk, sounding like a Warner Brother's cartoon character from the 40's or worse, some woke Disney creation.

J. SchabazZ,"Hey!
There are few things in life that can make you more miserable than crappy ill fitting shoes.  My gf just dropped a considerable chunk of change on some brand name loafers for me, while we were on holiday.  I have to say in hindsight, maybe I was more in love with the brand than the fit....and when you think about it, I can name a few dress shoes in my closet that also fit that description.  I can't just throw these in the back of the closet and not wear them for obvious reasons.

Now I'm a male, mid thirties and chunk of change to me is around $400 to $600 and at that price you want shoes to fit as well as they look.  I tried everything on these loafers:  a little stretch sauce, shoe stretcher, walking around the house with big socks, and even the hairdryer made an appearance.  What these shoes really need is time on my feet, but if you're like me I'm always short on time when it comes to walking around in semi-comfortable shoes.

I scour my favorite store (PLUG AMAZON), and discover these lil' guys....I got the black, size US M10 and threw them in the first day I received them - BOOM! - That's it, problem solved, perfect size, perfect support, shoes went worst to first in one minute.  One added benefit, is that the shoes heel was kind of digging into my achilles, but with the very slight height raise from the insert, my shoes are no longer on that sensitive bend in my foot.

If you are on your feet a lot I.E. outside sales, working conventions, weddings or really dont have the time to break in new shoes....I highly recommend these.  You could get spoiled by them and end up ordering for a lot more for all your shoes.",5.0,2015-08-01,United State
Staci,"I ordered this brand of insole many years ago, and I remember really liking them. The only reason I waited so long to purchase them again is that I prefer the full-length insoles, and they are hard to find on Amazon. Personally, I hate feeling where the insole stops, and I can always feel it. I also never understood the purpose of the 3/4 length. I get it now...it doesn't take up space in the toe box. I guess when I purchased them years ago, it wasn't a problem. Now it is!

I was excited to get these because I really need good arch support, and I really, really need metatarsal support. Honestly, I didn't feel these inserts offered much of either. Now, they are not designed to be worn in all shoes. They are meant to go in tighter-fitting shoes, whatever that means. I guess heels, perhaps. I do think they would have done better in tighter-fitting shoes, but they still wouldn't have had enough arch support. I do have high arches, so perhaps if you don't have high arches, these would be more suitable, but I still don't think they offer enough support. In addition, in my opinion, they offered no metatarsal support. They didn't offer support anywhere near where metatarsal support should be. I actually went back to make sure I purchased an adult size 8, which I did. Now, for the adhesion, I can't say much about it since I didn't remove the sticker. That said, it is very small, so I can't imagine it offered much sticking power, but  I could be wrong. Overall, they were a total failure for me.",2.0,2023-10-30,United State

I do like the heel pad, very nice, I had heel pain (burning pain) it's gone.

As for placement I put them under the liner/cushions in the shoe just as Natural Foot Orthotics recommends.
These work for my size 13 feet, are mostly solid on the bottom so no collapse is possible and if they do not hold up just buy more at this price point and the care of your very valuable feet its a deal
I have a pair if the Natural Foot Orthotics but 99 bucks a copy is not good .

I have froze can goods and rolled them under my feet
when I 1st read about doing that I laughed, when my arches were burning I quit laughing.
I have  had pretty bad plantar fasciitis at one time. The thing to do is stay in front of it with daily stretching.
When you actually mess up and get plantar fasciitis wear a sock every nite with tape around your foot ( not a lot of tape)  once around  the ankle and 3 times around the foot to keep tension on the tendon and  then stretch your foot with a belt before you set your feet on the floor. It can take months to get over.  At the very least 2, the sooner you start  the better  buy plenty of tape.  Don't wait do it!",5.0,2019-09-30,United State

justmelisa,"I have ordered the RooRuns brand three times now. They all feel great and work just as well as the brand name orthotics. My pup got ahold of one pair and partially chewed it up so I couldn't use it anymore but since they work so well, I went ahead and ordered another pair to replace them. I'm happy to say this replacement pair is the same great quality as the original pairs.

I love the 3/4 Length inserts, and definitely prefer them over the full length, as I can wear them in any of my shoes without removing the insole. Also, my foot does not feel cramped for space and my toes have plenty of room in the toe box. I have metatarsalgia and need extra support for my metatarsals. These orthotics provide a metatarsal pad and relieve the pain I get when not wearing the proper support. I wear them in my sneakers, slip-ons and boots (both heels and flat) and they fit great in all of them.

The insole will slide forward in the shoe but if you make sure it's seated in the correct position before you insert your foot, they will stay in place just fine. I haven't experienced any issues with it moving around while using them. Also, I don't use the sticky part under the heel pad because I move them around between different shoes.

I currently own 3 pairs of these orthotic inserts so I don't have to use the same pair every day. I've been using them for quite some time and they're all still in great condition, including the first pair I purchased over a year ago.

HEAVENS REIGN,"I soooo love these! They are similar to the expensive ones at that expensive foot store! They actually hold my arches up â€¦ because if you donâ€™t have a good foundation and your arches are falling, that causes corns and feet problems. These have a little padding in the ball of foot too, but they are primarily designed to just hold up the arch, not give a bunch of padding. You have to take them and put them under your regular shoe insoles padding. People who complain of them slipping arenâ€™t probably wearing them right. They go under the shoe insole padding. All the padding in the world wonâ€™t help you if your arches arent supported! These have helped me with bunion and corn issues! I actually walk straighter and not limping! I bought another pair so I can have one in my house shoes  and one in my regular shoes. You can buy those Velcro dots too to put in shoes that donâ€™t have removable insoles. I find that if you put them under the insoles, they donâ€™t slide around. I so love these!!! I have high arches and they are strong and donâ€™t bend.

Aaron Taslitz,"The Pedag Viva insole is tremendously comfortable and provides incredible arch support.  The Viva insole is great on its own or can be combined with another more affordable insole like Dr. Schollâ€™s work insole for a completely fit feel so that your feet arenâ€™t moving around inside the boot.  There is also immense comfort using Dr. Schollâ€™s work insole first and then the Pedag Viva insole on top as the feet are fully cushioned.  The Pedag Viva leather insole is top quality and is thin enough to fit into dress shoes.  The Pedag Viva insole is way more comfortable and supportive than the Dr. Schollâ€™s insoles.  The Pedag Viva insoles are definitely a must have for any shoe or boot being used daily for significant walking, standing, running, hiking, or biking.",5.0,2024-08-18,United State

Aaron Doran,"These are true to size. I have medium arches and most shoes for sale seem to have no arch support anymore. I have shoes ranging from $80-$400 and 90% of them regardless of construction quality offer very little in the way of arch support. These insoles are fantastic. If you have high arches I don't know that they'll be supportive enough and if you have low arches you may find them uncomfortable but if you are somewhere in between those two you can't go wrong with these. They are worth every penny. The heel cushioning is a plus but the two best things about them are how rigid the plastic is and how thin they are in the forefoot. The plastic does such a good giving support to the transverse and longitudinal arches and the thin forefoot means that even if your shoe or boot doesn't have a particularly high toe box you can still use these without feeling like your shoes or boots are too small or tight. The leather also feel great. It is more slippery than fabric though so that may come down to personal preference. Personally, I like a leather footbed. Lastly, I would not plan on just buying one pair and moving them from shoe to shoe. I tested them out in 4 or five different pairs of shoes to see how they felt in each (and they were awesome in all) but they are so rigid that they are somewhat difficult to get and out of the shoes and boots and I think this would lead to a premature separation of the leather footbed from the plastic support beneath it. I may just get a single pair to rotate through dress shoes since I don't wear them on a regular basis but I definitely wouldn't want to have to try to switch these between different pairs of shoes on a daily basis. If buying four or five of them seems a bit over the top see if your insurance will allow you to purchase them with your health savings account. I definitely plan on purchasing several more pairs.",5.0,2017-12-06,United State
Stylejuggler,"I had been wearing Superfeet Black orthotics for the past 10 years, and they worked very well.  Recently, my left outer ankle started hurting, and I realized it was caused by the rigid arch support of the Superfeet.  I decided to try a flexible orthotic instead.  I shopped around for a flexible orthotic that would be full length, offer some support for flat feet, yet still be thin enough to fit in my shoes without removable innersoles.  I tried the Superfeet FLEXthin, but the arch was a little too high for me, and the whole orthotic was a little thick.  The Pedag Viva Low is the only other option that I found.

I found the extra padding used in the Viva Low in the metatarsal area, and the heel to be rather uncomfortable for my feet, so I pulled the orthotic apart, and removed these two pads.  However, this still left the metatarsal area uncomfortable, as I could feel the carbon fiber support under the ball of my foot.  I remedied the situation by shortening the front area of the carbon fiber support by 3/4"", beveling the edge with a knife, and then filling in the indentation that is left where the carbon fiber was with a piece of rubber, cut from the bottom of a Dr. Scholl's AIR-PILLO Insole.  The end result is a very wearable orthotic, that fits my feet well, and is comfortable.

Since I know of no other product that comes ready made with the characteristics I am seeking, I will continue to buy and modify additional pairs of Viva Low, as I need additional pairs of orthotics.

Perhaps Pedag might consider at some point producing a version of the Viva Low, minus the metatarsal and heel pads, and with a slightly shorter carbon fiber arch support.  I would be ready to buy a whole bunch of them...",5.0,2020-12-29,United State

Lillian M. Matthews,"I have tried a variety of different inserts for my shoes being that I have semi-flat feet. As of lately, my arches are beginning to fall, and I suffer from plantar fasciitis. In my quest for the perfect pair of insoles I ordered the Pedag Viva shoe inserts. These were extremely well made and thin enough, but the arch was not sufficiently high, so they were of little use to me. I then ordered the Pedag Viva HIGH which is exactly the same, but has a higher arch support. This time the arch support was adequate, but the soles are SO hard and slippery that with my plantar fasciitis I can hardly wear them. They are thin enough to fit into any lady's high heel or shoe, but being that they are made of solid leather they have a very slippery surface that I dislike. I wish these were a little more cushioned and definitely less slippery. It is difficult to find a sole insert that is thin enough and yet provide adequate cushioning.

The only thing I would change is these do not fit the whole length of the shoe. They are meant to go from the heel to about mid arch to help with support in that area. The only issue with this, however, is each time I pull my foot out of the sneaker, the insert wants to come out too. Not a huge issue, but I think next time Iâ€™ll opt for inserts that fit the whole length of my shoe. (Of course understanding they too might come out with my foot).

Alex M. Cook,"As a young adult, I'm not proud of the fact that I need to wear these because of the work conditions that I'm under, for 8-10 hours, 5-6 days a week, in a harsh & unforgiving environment. I don't 'NEED' to wear these all the time and everywhere I go, but as for Work!, that's a different story.

With that being said, I'll gladly recommend these to anyone who needs a little bit extra ""protection"". I've tried other brands, store knock-offs, and other designs, but as for these?.....they're the best design, fit, and feel overall. Even the cost isn't horrible. It's not 'great', but 'not' horrible either. These have a nice stretchable waist to fit many body shapes, or if you're just not 'in' shape, but these will hug your body and flex with you. Trust me, I've tested this, willingly or not...lol.

What's nice about this design compared to others, is that the protective padding is more raised & focused on the front groin area, so leakage or a small run won't escape the coverage area. Even if it's #2, this has pretty good coverage & containment. These actually do have pretty good capabilities / quality of being able to absorb & hold in any bad smells or if things get...'messy'. Again!...believe me!....I've tested this.....unfortunately :-(.

Besides all that, these are pretty hidden and not bulky, or at least I don't think anyone notices. They feel pretty form fitting and I don't have to make any additional adjustments to my clothes to wear these, which makes me feel a little bit more 'normal' whenever I do need to wear these.

He wears these most days. He often puts a Tena guard inside because it's more comfortable against his skin and wears the Depend most of the day, changing it if there is leakage outside of the guard.

Someone should have either made a way to remove the padding or have sown the padding to the sides of the leg holes. I had hoped to do my part and TRY to not over load our landfill with diapers, but now that I have had awhile to deal with them, I don`t like them and I will not buy these for my husband anymore. The only positive is YES,it has  some really thick padding and the person that wears them loves them, and they do keep him and the bed dry, but for me who has to wash and dry them, not so much of love for them.

Calichigal,"I started using these in March (2024), for my adult son who has severe brain injury, and is incontinent.
These were designed for bed-ridden men, but my son is ambulatory.  However, he has some vision impairment, so he walks slowly and carefully.  If he strode a normal gait, they might not work as well.

I initially got one package, just to try.  I don't think he's too keen on the application, but once the wrap is in place, I believe it must be more comfortable.  He is also non-verbal, and is unable to actually tell me.  But, when I mistakenly thought he was trying to keep me from putting it on, on day 2, and started to get the other inserts I previously used (typical type that go between the legs), he vehemently prevented my doing so, and patiently allowed me to put the wrap on him, and has ever since.  Since he likes them, I ended up subscribing, which has worked out great, so far.

I am deducting a star due to them not really holding a large pee all that well, even when I use 2 wraps as recommended in the instructions.  This is the case when he is sitting, and laying down.  It could be partly because my son can hold it a LONG time, and then pees a very large amount all at once.

I am using this as an insert, and not a total replacement for his brief/pull-up, even in bed.  They do make changing him at night a breeze, when the pee is contained in the wrap, with little disturbance to him, as long as he's only wet.

To better contain the pee, and thereby keep his clothes dry - I place an insert inside the wrap, before wrapping it closed, I then fold the top front over toward the back, and the back over the front, and kind of hold them in place by placement of his pull-ups.  The insert I use has no waterproof backing, and is made to go inside incontinence briefs to help contain large pees.  The pictures included show how I place the insert.  This addition has helped greatly. (Inserts are Tranquility TopLiner Booster Pads)",4.0,2024-09-06,United State

It prevents having to change bedding. Since I started wearing two at night I rarely have leak through to the second one.

Debra H.,"I got these for my Dad whom is 87 years old. They help him, but he complains that they are bulky. If you have B.M. (bowl movement) incontinence this can catch that. But if you only have urine incontinence than this may be a little big or bulky for you. Dad prefers using lady's / women's incontinence pads.
These have an almost Velcro like grip strips and hold on well to cotton underwear. That's very good because they stay in place but don't leave behind gummy dots of glue on underwear.
I hope my review helps people make intelligent choices when purchasing products for incontinence. I believe this would be a perfect product if it were more narrow in the middle so legs can walk without the pad bunching up in the crotch area. I'm guessing that explains why this is uncomfortable for Dad. But I will say that this holds quite a lot too. Now Dad says that he can feel the wetness with this moreso than with the popular women's name brand incontinence pads he likes to use. And these don't have a nice scent to them, so that should help people that have sensitive skin issues, where scented products cause skin irritation. I can understand that no one wants to have skin problems in their underwear and also have to deal with incontinence problems.",4.0,2024-03-10,United State
Sheryldine Bates,"This product allows protection of the Depend or other incontinence wear. You can remove and replace it during the day before bath time to extend the period of dryness. My only issue is that the pad is 18 inches long. That is long, however, it is for an adult male and I need one that fits from the top front of the Depend and extends to the top back of the Depend. This one stops somewhere near the bottom.  I then tried the 2400 and though it is long enough 27 inches, perfect, it does not have adhesive strips. You can purchase double sided tape to adhere it at the front and back to the Depend. I tried that and it works ok.

Retired Bookworm,"These are not what I thought I was getting. I wanted booster pads that fit insider incontinence underwear to increase the amount of absorption. But these are a regular pad, with a plastic backing. Urine doesn't pass through it into the host underwear like a regular booster pad.

The pad itself is adequate for lighter protection by itself, for the average person, but not for a plus-size figure. It has two velcro-type strips to attach to regular underwear. And the plastic liner. But the crotch area still isnt any wider than an average one, and when it gets full it runs out the sides, bypassing the host panty, and leaking around my legs--the very thing I was hoping they would prevent..

I am really very disappointed in these items, and won't buy them again. It is so frustrating, as a big person, to have to experiment with brand after brand to find something wide enough and long enough to prevent leaks. Guess I'll keep hunting.",3.0,2023-04-11,United State

Sheila,"After reading some other reviews about these pads not staying in place, I was hesitant but decided to try them anyway and I'm very glad I did.  They are intended to be used inside disposable incontinence underwear so that you can change just the pad and thereby extend the use of the underwear for a longer period of time.  These pads have a strip of very lightweight ""velcro-like"" material on the underside of each end.  These strips lightly adhere to the disposable underwear so they stay in place but are still very easy to remove and replace without changing the underwear.  Other pads I have tried have a lengthwise glue strip which makes them impossible to remove without damaging the underwear so, if the pad is full, then you have to change the underwear each time which defeats the purpose of adding the pads.  Using these pads could extend the life of the underwear to one per day, which will save a lot of money in the long run for anyone who currently goes through multiple pairs of underwear per day., not to mention the convenience of not having to completely undress in order to change the underwear, especially when you're not at home.  I also want to mention that, although the description states ""Plus, the individual pads are wrapped in plain packaging, making them easy to carry in purse or pocket."", they are NOT individually wrapped so, in order to keep them sanitary while carrying them in your purse or pocket, you would have to put them inside something such as a ziplock bag.",5.0,2020-12-23,United State
Ayda,"I have a connective tissue disease that caused me to need these starting at a much earlier age than most. No matter what your reason to need them, I have tried seemingly countless types and brands. They all had very inconvenient issues to deal with of various degrees until I found LivDry and Tena. These 2 brands have given me the part of my life and confidence that had been stripped away. The full undergarment type cause me to sweat so much it ends up looking like Iâ€™ve wet myself anyway, not to mention how uncomfortable sweating like that makes you when wearing them in itself already sucks and limits the types of clothing you can wear comfortably. Other pad type of brands either leaked, smelled bad, didnâ€™t stay in place, were wet against my skin, made me sweat, wouldnâ€™t work for overnight protection or a mix of several of these issues. I decided to try the LivDry in Ultimate and Moderate and have found both equally effective. The only issue I have had is slight displacement of a pad a couple of times with the LivDry, but only after a very long day and still had no leakage issues despite it being somewhat out of place. With the LivDry, I have found I actually forget I am wearing them. If you have to rely on this type of product, you know how great that speaks of this particular brand! I personally tend to prefer the Tena for overnight use, though both are equally effective. Another bonus of having a significantly smaller product that works as effectively as a much larger one means it is easier to carry, easier to store and causes much less waste. Considering all of this, along with the lower price in addition to the better all around comfort of this product as compared to pull-up styles or other brands, I will never change back as long as they stay this great!!",5.0,2020-01-29,United State

G.R.M.,"These â€œultimateâ€ absorbency, six 6, supposedly absorb 300 cc, about 10 ounces. Iâ€™m sure they do if you can release a half ounce at at time.  But if you have a gush, even much less than 10 ounces, it does not absorb fast enough and spills over the â€œleak barrierâ€ and wicks up the butt crack to give you a wet spot in the back of your panties/pants/gown or dress.  If you have a gush urine can also wick up your front, giving you a matching wet spot in the front if your clothes.

Being thin is nice- if they work.  Unfortunately, these do not.  They need to be wider, the leak barrier needs to go the entire length if the pad, and they need to be longer.

I don't need a thicker pad or a longer pad that sticks out in all the wrong places. I need a slightly wider pad at the top/front, and this pad is the perfect shape with plenty of coverage without bulk. Plus, it is very soft and thin compared to most of the similar Poise and Always products. This is an extremely comfortable daily pad.

Active Shooter,"This is working great. I bought it primarily to clean vinyl albums (records), but it also works just as well for other cleaning tasks.
Very happy with the device, my only complaints:
1. Upon arrival it smelled terrible. My assumption is that the device was tested at some time, then packaged while it was still a bit damp. Unsealing the package was like taking a swim in a murky swamp. But, that odor quickly went away with some airing out, and use.
2. The up/down buttons for time and temperature are inverted. By inverted, I mean the up, or increase button is below the down, or decrease button. Not a big deal, but from a usability perspective it is a bit backwards from the intuitive solution of putting the up button on the top.

Things I like:
1. The cover fits well and keeps the tank clean when not being used. It does little/nothing to reduce the noise.
2. The built in heater is handy, but I have not used it yet. I know people love to run these cleaners at a high temp, but it does not make sense. You'll get more effective cavitation at lower temps. Raising the temp will increase solubility of the solvent, but also decrease cavitation. The two need to be balanced for the best result.
3. The tank is not huge and too heavy, but the handles are appreciated. The drain valve is also nice for tank changes without the need to lift the entire unit.
4. Semiwave, fullwave, and degas modes. I have not seen a big difference between the cleaning power of semi and full modes, but they both work well (on albums). Degas mode is handy after filling the unit.
5. It is a great looking unit with the light texture, and matching blue handles, valve, and graphics.

The unit was replaced and I have been using it for a little over a week now and it works great. The unit heats up to whatever setting I set it at and maintains that temperature. I love this unit and the time it saves me in my chainsaw repair shop. I can put items in the unit to clean and walk away from it and do other things. When I come back at the end of the cleaning cycle the parts are clean. All I have to do is used compressed air to dry them off and blow off any other debris. It also works great to clean up the chainsaw chains before sharpening. This keeps the grinding wheel from building up with oil/sap.

Am not sure if it actually reaches the specified power for heating and ultrasonic (based on it's power consumption from 110 mains) but it's not too far.

If you wonder how the degas function works, it repeatedly turns the ultrasonic wave on for 6 secs and off for 2 secs, because somehow it accelerate the release of gases from the cleaning liquid. Supposed to do it once each time you refill with liquid, for best cleanup.

Documentation is brief, one page per language, but on good quality paper, and reasonable English, and easy to understand in general.

The basket has two modes, one where is suspended on the handles, which I use during cleanup, and one where the handles are folded in and it supported by 4 feet, which I use during storage (it allows to fully cover the unit).

You press the heat button and it will heat up to desired temperature then stop and keep it consistent but once you press the cleaning cycle when the cleaning cycle is finished the heater shuts off and will no longer heat up so it basically cancels out the heating once the cycle is finished so you can let it preheat to get up to temperature and then put your items in there to clean it once the cleaning is over. The heat will shut off and everything will stop so very nice. This is a very powerful little machine. It seems well built. I love the fact that it has the temperature adjustment auto shut off and also the semi wave, full wave and D gas function.

Michelle Mcbride,"This jewelry cleaner machine is a game-changer! My rings, necklaces, and even delicate earrings look brand new after just one cycle. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to useâ€”just add water and a bit of cleaning solution, and it does all the work.

I was amazed at how much dirt came off, even on pieces I thought were already clean. The machine is quiet, compact, and works quickly, making it perfect for regular use. Itâ€™s also gentle enough for delicate stones. If you want your jewelry to sparkle like itâ€™s fresh out of the store, this cleaner is a must-have!

Larry Wolf,"Impressive Ultrasonic Cleaner for the price.  Surprised it's 100% Stainless Steel including pull out trays, etc.  Digital readouts very large easy to read.  I have only had the produce 1 day but seems to work well in cleaning inkjet heads.  Although I'm unable to free up yellow ink jet on a head that had been left out in cold for 6 years it's promising as black now works good, blue works 95% +, Magenta 50+% but can't see Yellow at all yet.  But I haven't used heater yet which is difficult to to change setting as it seems to only go up or down by 10 degrees centigrade and wish it had a Fahrenheit setting darn.  Been using a 50:50 mixture of H202 and ISP which should give it the best cleaning action.  Timer works well.  Heater does work not sure of accuracy but it does get hot.

You can set the heat, run time, etc. Pro tip, if your parts fit in a bag, fill that with your solution, and fill the tank with distilled water. It will do the job just the same at a fraction of the cost. I love the drain for easy cleaning, or fluid reuse.

May not be the product you receive!,"Unboxed the unit and was impressed with the looks for the price. Plugged it in with the supplied power cord. While filling the tank with distilled water I noticed the odor of burning electrical. I stopped filling it anymore for fear it was about to short out and I would have to return it already. Decided after letting it sit for 30 minutes to continue filling it with water. Once it was full I took a shot and turned on the first test cycle. It ran without issue and I could see the water agitating from all area of the tank. I ran it this way for 15 minutes and kept smelling the odor. I shut it off and let it sit for about 2 hours and monitored it during this time. It never blew a fuse, tripped a breaker, anything. I ran it again with a beaker of solution and some parts and they came out clean. It looks to be ok and appears to be working but the electrical odor has me worried to ever walk away from it plugged in our running without being ready to quickly unplug it from the wall when it shorts out or goes up in smoke. I worry about it burning down my lab. Not sure if I will keep it or send it back.",3.0,2024-10-25,United State
Multi_sun_die,"I'm not here to hate on this ultrasonic It's only $50 even though about a year ago when I purchased mine it was more like 65 or $70. I bought the small two or three liter version I forget exactly but that didn't really matter what matters is it's lifespan which was horrible. I have a lot of experience with using ultrasonics because I was a bench jeweler for 20 years and we used them all day every day. But not being able to afford a decent $800 unit this thing was very appealing especially at its price point and I did not need a very big one cuz I was only using it to clean jewelry not any major auto parts like a carburetor or anything like that. I mentioned earlier that I have a lot of experience using ultrasonics only because I want to make sure that folks understand that I know how to properly use one of these machines without giving it any chance to get damaged in any way. Basically it's not that hard just follow the instructions but make sure to follow the instructions Don't overfill your water past the fill line In fact if you don't need to fill your water that high don't just fill it enough that it will completely cover whatever it is you're cleaning If you're cleaning just some small jewelry parts I would still fill it up at least a third to halfway only because you don't want to risk burning up the heating mechanism. That brings me to the second part of the directions that you must follow never run this thing dry always make sure you have at least a third of a tank of water in there before you plug it in and turn the heating mechanism on. The real deal ultrasonics that cost anywhere between 800 to unfortunately a couple thousand dollars actually will heat your water up from room temperature to however hot you set the temperature to. These little cheap ultrasonics and I'm not just calling out Creworks on this issue but probably just about every budget ultrasonic that claims to be ""self heating"" or ""heated"" I would be very weary of what that claim actually means. If you want it to heat up to whatever temperature you said it to it's going to take some time some real time like possibly an hour or more depending on how much room temperature water you put in it to go from room temperature to your desired heat. You should always preheat your water not quite to boiling as a lot of people suggest but pretty darn hot then add it to your ultrasonic and turn your heater on after you plug it in It works much better at maintaining already heated water then actually heating up the water itself which is kind of a letdown because it's a whole other step that takes time if you do it on your stove top specifically. I suppose you could heat your water in the microwave much faster but still what's the point when it's supposed to heat itself up? Still that is not a big deal who cares right So you got to heat up your own water as long as it maintains the heat I'm cool with that for 50 bucks.
This is my real true complaint about this specific ultrasonic itself. I followed the directions to a t each time I've used it which was only 3 times it worked great all three times. The fourth time I went to use it I heated up my water, added the water to the unit, plugged in the unit, turned the heater on and set it to my desired temperature, then was ready to start cleaning but after setting the timer on the ultrasonic I pushed the on button that actually starts the ultrasonic and unfortunately nothing whatsoever turned on. That was it after only 3 uses of this ultrasonic unit it was dead and gone for good. I noticed that it does come with a spare fuse so I we t ahead and switches it out even though you could clearly see that the original fuse was fine and wasnt even close to looking blown or burnt. Without having to tell you the outcome obviously that didn't fix the problem. The problem was the train due switch had already gone to crap and I treated that thing like it was a very fragile crystal bowl. I took wonderful care of it and it crapped out on me after only getting to use it 3 times. So on that 4th attempt to use it when I discovered it was broken I had used it so speringly up to that point it was wayyyy past Amazon's 30 day money back guarantee and what really sucked is that it was just about 1 month past Creworks 1 year manufacturer's warranty. But I was going to try and contact Creworks anyway and see if they would be willing to do me some kind of solid, I wasn't expecting them to replace it I was kind of hoping I could send it into them and they would repair it for me That was also a no but after a few emails back and forth between me and one of the customer service agents I got my final email from them and it was titled Great news we have the replacement parts you need so I was excited and I clicked on it and began to read what needed to be done and how I needed to go about getting these replacement parts. After about the second or third sentence I realized that the great news was actually pretty crappy news yeah sure they had the replacement parts I needed to fix it on my own but the great news to them was and I quote we have the parts you need to replace in stock for only $34.99 and we will send them to you. They seriously expected me to pay $35 to replace the crappy transducers that broke after three uses when I can literally buy another brand new unit for 15 more dollars which I was not even considering doing. I took a chance on CreeWorks because it had a lot of decent reviews maybe I got a dud I'm not sure but I will never buy one of their products again specifically because they were not willing to cut me any kind of deal to replace parts that should not have broken after three uses. That's like losing $10 and paying somebody $7.50 to get the $10 back but you're actually paying $17.50 for that $10 if that makes any sense to y'all. It appears in the world of inexpensive cheap but industrial ""looking""ultrasonics on Amazon the two major players are Creworks and Vevor. I don't have any experience with Vevor but they come with pretty decent reviews just about equal to what kree works has on most of their models. I doubt I'll ever buy a Vevor though I've come very close several times because I really need an ultrasonic and not one of those little plastic things that you put your dentures or your glasses in I mean a real ultrasonic that is made out of 304 Steel that does make an obnoxiously loud rattling sound because those are the only ones that actually work. And having a heater or no heater isn't even an option for me You have to have a heated unit if you really want to get your stuff clean it's a no-brainer. It's also a major no-brainer to avoid this Creworks ultrasonic and their greedy customer service. I apologize This is probably the most negative for you I've ever given on anything but I can't get past them wanting to charge me $35 to fix a $50 unit and fix it myself I've never taken one of these apart I mean I'm sure it comes with instructions but they weren't even willing to let me send it in and then fix it for me for $35 They wanted to send me the parts and I attempt to do some I assume soldering and whatever the hell else It takes to replace a transducer. No thank you I will be buying an ultrasonic sooner or later but I think I'm going to have to cough up at least four or $500 just to be safe. The good thing about spending that kind of money on one is you know what you're getting and you know that it's going to last if you take care of it.",2.0,2023-08-23,United State
Bradio,Check out my video what a cool Sonic cleaner I had a Sonic cleaner maybe like 10 years ago but it was nothing like this. I don't know how there could be bad reviews on this particular item I mean I've never seen anything like it it even polishes silver with the right cleaner check out my video I'll show you guys some of the dirt coming off the rings and also the cleaner that I put in it it's called blitz I actually get it here on Amazon but back to the Sonic cleaner that cleaner works really good I thought I was getting rings really clean with a toothbrush and dipping them in cleaner but the Sonic cleaner really really gets all the dirt and breaks up the particles and then it gets released and it really just kind of cleans it unlike anything I've ever seen before. Check out my video hopefully that helps a little bit and I like to warm it up and heat it up and get it real hot before I put the jewelry in that way it helps it breaks up some of the dirt I think.

Daryl,"Knocked one star off because the 15L is not 15L, ""unless Chinese liters are smaller,"" this one only holds 10L. No fault from the seller as the box that it comes in has the 15L model number and the ID label says 15L.
Purchased another brand previously and it lasted one cycle before it died. So far this one has lasted 37 times longer and I have been completely satisfied with the results. The noise level is tolerable, not much louder than barber clippers, but if you are going to be in the same room you may want to wear ear protection as the constant hum may give you a headache.
A few little tips,
Read the directions.
I put the items to clean in the basket then fill the basin to the marks inside the unit with hot water before turning the unit on, this will save a lot of time, and keeps the unit from overflowing. If you want the cleaning solution to be warmer I suggest turning on the cleaning cycle as it seems to make the solution warm faster.
If you watch the cleaning you will notice small bubbles rise from the parts. Once the bubbles stop coming off the parts, turn the parts over and wait until the bubbles stop again and they will be about as clean as they're going to get, and may help lessen the chance of ruining the items surface coatings. Make sure to rinse the parts ASAP then dry them off with compressed air if possible to knock out any residual loose particles.",4.0,2024-11-22,United State
JoeD,"I have gone through a few small, budget priced ultrasonic cleaners in my shop. They usually work OK. Temperature control is always iffy, there is often no facility to degas cleaning solutions and cleaning action isn't great. Eventually the heating elements go or the transducers go.

The CREWORKS 6L Digital Ultrasonic Cleaning Machine is impressive for a number of reasons.
The unit has three transducers which is on the upper end of transducer count for a 6 liter unit.

The machine has a degassing function that can be used throughout the cleaning process, cycling between degas and clean, or for time of operator choice.

The Creworks has excellent temperature control. There is a solution temperature rise above ambient with heat turned off, but this is normal for ultrasonic cleaning and caused by process cavitation. As an example, solution temperature rose from 61Â°F to 68Â°F during a full power, 30 minute cleaning cycle.

The 6 liter size is handy. Usually they are too small to fit all of the machine pieces I work with, or too large and waste solution. This one is right for me, particularly with this tank's capacity and aspect ratio.

The unit is well made. nicely finished and it definitely improves the appearance of my work bench.

Of greatest importance, it cleans parts really well, and it does so quickly; light oxidation, waxy grease, general crud. The ultrasonic process gets into every surface. I'm very happy with the Creworks machine.",5.0,2024-12-17,United State

I have put a few things to clean through it and have been overall satisfied with it's performance. It cleans well and the gentle function comes in handy with delicate items. It is well constructed and the finish on it is really amazing. It is loud, but every ultrasonic cleaner is, but is bearable if it is in the garage or another room. The extended timer is really handy but the manual says to limit to 30 minutes cycle. I haven't been able to figure out any way to change the temperature reading from F to C. For the price it is well worth it, but in my opinion, I would definitely try and get a size bigger than you think, you would think that maybe a 3L version is enough for your needs, but once you have a ultrasonic cleaner you will find bigger things to clean with it.

Robert Reed Obenour,"I am pleased with the Creworks sonic cleaner.  It seems to work well, is expectedly noisy although I don't find its noise level objectionable, and has good design.  The handles are cool and convenient to grip, the interior surface is stainless steel, of course, and cleans easily, and I have had no problem with the exterior finish.  This one has the electronic controls which are fine with me, but I think I might have liked the manual controls a bit better--easier to operate.  Heat is variable, timing goes up to 30 minutes, de-gas feature is excellent, and the gentle cycle is nice to have available.  The 3-liter size works very well for jewelry, eyeglasses, and dental items, yet the overall size is quite manageable, doesn't weight much, and takes up little counter space.

Ryan,"The good part is this does clean things. Itâ€™s quite good at that. The bad part is I have no confidence in the temp control. I set it to 85, and when the cleaning was done it was so hot I checked it with a thermometer- 156!! Iâ€™m not sure if its temp sensor doesnâ€™t work, or the relay controlling the heating element is junk, or what. Regardless, I donâ€™t trust it enough to use the heater anymore. (And Iâ€™ve only had it for a week or soâ€¦)",2.0,2025-02-15,United State
dev,"It seems like all of these overshoot their set temps which is why I returned a different brand for this one. I then come to find out that it has been a reported issue and I think people are over cooking these machines which can ruin Items you put in by taking off coatings or paint and making the machine have a short life.
This Creworks is no different. I find that you need to understand it by monitoring the temps using a cooking thermometer and managing an offset.  The temp display on the machine is accurate without the vibration but it is not once its on and doing the ultrasonic cleaning for reasons I cant explain but it shows it to be at least 12-15F degrees cooler than it actually is. In addition to this the ultrasonic action also increases heat over time which can change the offset you set.

The best way I found to control temps is to set the temp you want before you turn on the ultrasonic function.  Say you want cleaning at around 135F, set it at 132F.  Once the set temps are reached set the offset at 118F for the heater to kick on or what ever offset works for you to keep the temps stable at 132F when the ultrasonic function is on.  Over time the temps will rise to 135F as you monitor it externally using a cooking thermometer because the ultrasonic action will increase the heat for your 30 minute cycle due to the heat dissipation of the transducers.  Once 30 minutes is expired and it stops vibrating you will see the temp on the display rise from 118F to 135F which is the actual temp.  Most important follow the manual and let the machine cool down for 15 minutes before another cycle.
Reading a lot of these reviews is depressing but I have a feeling that these machines are getting much hotter than the actual temp with most users unaware  and with heat it creates malfunctions with the electronics which go bad.
 What is junk for some is an opportunity to get the most out of a unit like this at its price point with some awareness and a work around. Im at least happy that it has a 1 year warranty compared to others with a US contact.
 Everything is working great so far and the cleaning is exceptional but I am giving it four stars because the manufactures of these cheap machines should have found a better way to regulate temps or at least mention it.  There is a video review where they mention that thermostatic  control does not work which is wrong, it does work great as long as you set the offsets while the machine is running otherwise it will be too hot which gives you the impression that the heater relay does not turn off.",4.0,2024-02-09,United State
Jordan S.,"Many of the reviews of the smaller units complain that it takes forever for it to heat the solution in a reasonable amount  of time. This model however, has a heating element that is twice as big as smaller units. It takes just over an hour to bring it from room temperature to the max operating temperature of 80 degrees C. (174f) I just wish I could figure out how to switch the display to Celsius.
One thing to note though, when the cleaning medium is at 80c the unit only has about a 15% duty cycle. It will run the ultrasonic generator for about 10 seconds, then turn off for about 50 seconds. It makes hot cleaning more like a soak than an ultrasonic cleaning. I have to run my parts for several 30 minute cycles to get the cleaning action I'm looking for.
Though the total volume with no parts in it is 5 qts,. the chrome plated steel basket is only a little more than 3 qts in size. And the mesh is about 1/4"" so, small parts require their own basket of fine mesh stainless steel screen.",4.0,2024-11-07,United State

Silver Chibi,"I do a lot of beadwork and a lot of my materials get imported, especially crystals and gems. The problem is that some of these have been sitting around and collecting dust and possibly grime, and thus they lose their luster and can be a bit of a pain to clean by hand. Been searching for a bunch of different baskets to use to wash them in my small ultrasonic cleaner (Only big enough to fit a pair of glasses comfortably, and shallow enough that it doesn't come with one). These popped up in my search and they're perfect for my stashes of gemstone and crystal beads.

The super tiny one (And it is very tiny, about the same circumference of a thimble!) is perfect for the screws on my glasses, as well as other small components I have that needs special care. The medium is great for single gemstones and fancy stones, even earring studs and smaller earrings. The large one is great for cleaning mass amounts of beads without worrying about fishing them out one by one from the bath; also good for rings.

It's very well made and extremely sturdy. Mesh is very secured My only qualm is that some times it is a bit hard to line up the threads to screw them together, and a little hard to open after a wash, but the opening part is because I think I screw them a little too tightly... ^^;;;; My sis wants to give it a run since she also has tiny components (Mostly screws and nuts from her computer and other tech toys) that need a good washing.

Brian,"One of the ratings they asked me for was ""softness"". I have no idea how soft they are. The one thing I do know (as a brand new amature photographer) is that you don't want to get any of the oils from you body onto the applicator that you'll be using on your camera sensor. I've used them muliple times now and they seem to be cleaning the sensor just as they are meant to. For the money... you get a lot of them.

Stan the Handyman,"If you see dark shadows/marks, or, darker round, circular spots, especially in areas such as clear, cyan sky, or other bright, single-color surfaces in your digital photos, that usually means that the image sensor has been contacted by aerosols and other solid debris, like fibers, hairs, and dust. This procedure is only to be done with a fully-charged camera battery in camera because the shutter must be set to the longest time interval available to the DSLR camera (usually 30 minutes ) to retract the mirror. It must be up and out of the way to the image sensor, which is deep, near the rear plane of the camera. Do this under good, overhead lighting. Use of an Opti-Visor is strongly recommended. After carefully blowing away any solid particulate matter with a bulb or syringe type blower, you're ready to use a swab. These swabs start life dry. They're used as a ""broom"" of sorts to sweep away any stubborn debris on the image sensor itself. THIS IS THE CRITICALLY GENTLE PART OF THE PROCEDURE. The image sensor is extremely delicate and significant force should never be applied to it. If, however, there remain spots which may be oily or aqueous in nature, these can be removed by breathing down into the opened camera cavity and immediately using the very edge end of a fresh swab. Only when all else fails, methanol, or denatured alcohol can be used, only on the end edge of the swab. Maintain the swab vertically while sweeping in only one direction, twice. I do it L to R.",5.0,2024-01-23,United State

Francis Tapon,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is a bit expensive. It deserves four stars. the only reason I'm giving it five stars is simply to make up for some critics who I think are being a bit too harsh. You get four basic products in this kit. If you think of it as $10 per product, you might understand why it's a bit expensive. First, it comes with a tumbler blower which are designed to blow the dust inside the gaps of the lens hot shoes, and zoom rings.

Number two, they have cleaning cloths that are used for cleaning the dust off the camera's body and the lens it's important to use the cloth with the lens cleaner.

There are also cotton swabs which are designed for cleaning up the dirt and dust inside the gaps of the hot shoe, Zoom rings, touch spots, and any other area that is difficult to clean. And lastly, you have a lens brush to brush away larger sized dust particles on the surface of the lens.

Brennan,"The packaging was kinda neat and fancy, but the lables and instructions/writing was a lot of nonsense. The items themselves are decent, but look a lot nicer in the picture. Basically just run of the mill cheap Chinese stuff... but shiny...

I also got this one cause of the carrying/storage bag, but it's incredibly cheap and junky. Don't let it influence your purchase. If your gonna buy this, fine, but don't let the included storage bag be the deciding factor, it's not worth it. The lens pen is also really basic and not very nice.

Really, the blower is the best thing in here. You're essentially buying a real expensive blower with some cheap extract throwing. A super cheap brush, an almost disposable bag, a few wet wipes, and a bottle of probably alcohol/water. Blower is nice though, but doesn't move much air at all.

Really, the kit does what it claims, but it's worth about 40% of the price, IMO. Think of it like cardboard cutout prop of a Lamborghini. It looks like a sweet, expensive ride from a distance, but once you get up close in person, it's just a flat piece paper. That's how I felt after seeing the item listing, and then when it arrived. It's not TERRIBLE, I mean, it's at least a 3 star item, but I'm giving it 2 due to the cost.",2.0,2024-07-18,United State
Hairy Potter,"This lens cleaning kit includes everything needed in a cleaning kit.  It has a couple of really nice features, and a couple that are not so great.  The kit includes an air blower, a lens brush, lens cleaner fluid, 8 cotton swabs, 8 microfiber camera/lens cleaning cloths, 5 screen cleaning wet wipes, and a carrying pouch.

On the positive side, the air blaster is designed to always right itself when set down.  This is a good design which keeps the air discharge nozzle from touching the ground and possibly collecting dust.  The lens brush is contained in a metal tube, and after taking off the cap, the brush extends with a twist.  I like this design, since the tube protects the brush well.

On the negative side, the cotton swabs are all in one package instead of being separately packaged.  It is hard to open the package to get only one swab out without possibly contaminating the swab next to it. It can be done, but the manufacturer should either separately package the swabs or spread them out more in the single package. The included lens cleaner fluid is too small.  There should be a larger amount of fluid included.

The price of this kit seems unreasonably high at $40.",4.0,2021-02-07,United State
Jeffrey N. Fritz,"The VSGO Professional Lens Cleaning Kit is handy for keeping cameras, lenses and camera sensors clean.

Modern interchangeable lens cameras are subject to getting dust on their lenses and sensors. These tiny dust particles are a byproduct of removing and replacing the lenses. The dust shows up as spots or dark places on an image--especially one that has a bright element such as the sky.

The VSGO Professional Lens Cleaning Kit contains the VSGO Filter Air Blaster with Filter Tumbler that I have reviewed previously. It is a small, but decent air blaster useful for cleaning lenses and dust from interchangeable (DSLR and mirrorless) camera sensors.

Besides the air blaster, the kit contains eight Microfiber cleaning cloths, five wet wipes, a small bottle of lens cleaning fluid, a metal brush and eight cotton swabs. Also included is a handy zippered folding pouch with a Velcro fastener to keep everything neatly organized.

Of course you can buy all these items separately. And you probably will need to resupply the cleaning fluid, the wipes and the cotton swabs. But getting these cleaning items together and with a pouch makes this more convenient. It is an good cleaning starter kit for beginning photographers.",4.0,2021-01-09,United State
C,"This is a below average camera cleaning kit.

This was probably designed by somebody who doesn't own a camera. Every single item could be (and it actually is) better in way less expensive cleaning kits.

-Starting from the 8 TINY Dustless Cotton Swabs. In a single package. Not individually packaged. The head of the swabs is ridiculously tiny. Funny enough while they may be dustless, they sure have loose strands. Anything wider is more useful to say, clean the sensor or mirror of your camera.

-Then the lens cleaner fluid that clearly says: ""Do not spray directly to lens"". Okay makes sense. So i am going to spray the fluid on the SINGLE 1-3/4"" Vacuum Sealed Lens cloth that comes in the kit. Okay.

-Oh maybe the ""filtered"" Air blower, with it's 3/4"" long nozzle. It feels nice to the touch and has nice, stylized eyes on it's silicone body. I would have preferred a longer nozzle of course to, you know, reach places in a camera without having to fit the whole pump bladder in it.

- Then the camera cleaning clothes (8) Described on the packaging as general purpose cleaning cloth, use on lens, body and DSLR mirror and sensor. I guess these are fine.

-Anti Bacteria Screen Cleaning Wet Wipes (x5) Okay, these are quite useful to clean the camera body, i used one and they are kind of dry to be wet. I own a Sony a6400 so it's a small camera and it was dry to clean the whole outer body.

-The cleaning brush was decent. A little wider than usual but not necessarily a bad thing. It retracts so it's compact but it has a good amount of soft density bristles.

-The carrying case is decent, i mean it's a decent soft case. No padding at all and while not absolutely necessary, you can find better carrying cases and kits for way less, that would apply much better to the cleaning of your camera.

I would have given 3 stars to this kit had it costed $19.99-24.99 but at $39.99 this is terrible value, you can get Altura's Pro Cleaning Kit for $29.99 where everything is nicer for $10 less. 2 Stars.",2.0,2021-01-24,United State
J. Lanson,"Cape Cod metal polish has become my go to watch polish, for those who love their time pieces and want to preserve its brilliant shine will want to at some point look for a good polish to use at home. I really have to give the company a lot of credit for making such as classy can, it comes with very clear instructions on top of the lid. The polish is for silver, gold, brass, copper, nickel, pewter, aluminium, and stainless steel. Yes it can be used with coated metals for watches and kitchen utensils, I can't vouch for bush craft knives or other cutting tools that have some kind of decorative coating on handles. The instructions says you can lightly polish coated metals, so I'm assuming it will work just as well with a light touch-up.

The kit comes with twelve 4/6&#34; sheets, one microfiber buffing cloth, and 1 pair of large blue nitrile glove. The cloths are soaked in mineral oil and polishing compound, the towel cloths are nice and thick for it to be reusable. I tested on a stainless steel pan, and it works wonders, so easy to use.

I cleaned two of my Seiko watches that I wear daily for daily tasks. The outer bezel was fairly scratched up, with a deep pit on my kinetic watch; so I pressed harder to work the polish into the stainless steel to clear out the scratches. For those who have never used polishing cloth, I would definitely recommend this. There are a couple of things that'll help you detail your fine jewelry pieces:

Q-tips - cut the cotton head of Q-tip at a sharp angle, this will give you a non-scratch tip to work around the crown, back case, and between the lugs.

Extra microfiber clothes - when the polishing and buffing cloth turns gray, use a new surface for better results.

I've included some pictures to show you the results of the polish, some of the scratches are actually fiber filament from the microfiber, but as you can see, the light, and my fingers are reflected from the mirror like finish. I tried to get some angles to show the shine, and the polish really brings out the shine!",5.0,2016-11-22,United State

And, that look last a long time before needing to be repolished again. I highly recommend it. I guess the secret of this product is that it polishes as well as cleans.

Paul D. Sullivan,"I bought this based on customer reviews and doing some online searches for something to polish my stainless steel watch collection. This seemed to fit the bill. The entire kit comes packed in a metal can and inside you will find twelve individual polishing cloths wrapped in a plastic film and sealed (2) per plastic bag, one buffing cloth and one pair of latex gloves. The directions are on the lid of the can in English and French. The company is based in Dennis Massachusetts, which is located on Cape Cod and hence the name. The clothes are impregnated with a petroleum distillate, which is somewhat aromatic, but not unpleasant.

The manufacturer claims the following on the side of the can:

""Cleans the toughest jobs, polishes to a mirror shine, protects with our anti-tarnishing formula which significantly stretches time between polishes. Pleasant aroma. And finally Superior polish for Silver, Gold, Brass, copper, nickel, pewter, aluminum ans stainless steel.""

I can say the following about the product:

I bought it to polish my stainless steel watch cases and watch bracelets. It did a great job (although I have to admit I have allot of watches, and most are protected in watch display boxes). I even used it on an extremely cheap watch that was plated with stainless steel and rusting and it polished it up pretty good. Since most of my watches did give the product much of a challenge, I tried it out on some very tarnished silver items; an old Ronson Queen Anne lighter and a very blck silver butter knife. Used alone it didn't do a great job, but when I used it in conjunction with TWINKLE silver polish I got an outstanding result. I've used Twinkle allot but am usually disappointed with the result. When I followed up with the Cape Cod polishing cloth, I got an outstanding finish.

The polishing cloths themselves are like a felt cloth, and you can easily tear them if they get hooked on a sharp point. Once removed from the sealed plastic bag they can dry out. I resealed the one I used in a small zip lock bag to retain the distillates.

So what I can honestly say about the product:

Heavily tarnished silver with Cape Cod polishing cloth only. So, so.
Heavily tarnished silver with Twinkle polish followed by Cape Cod polishing cloth. Excellent.
Stainless steel watch cases and bracelets: Excellent.

Andy K,"Noticed a scratch on my Omega the other day and although I usually donâ€™t mind scratches, this one just popped out every time I looked at the watch. I was always afraid to polish my own watch as I thought I would damage or ruin it. I decided to buy these Cape Cod wipes and give it a shot. After watching some videos on other people using these wipes, I decided to cover the whole watch except for the scratch area with scotch tape. This way I didnâ€™t have to worry about scratching the crystal or polishing any brushed areas. I put on the included gloves, and began gently scrubbing the scratch area. The smell of the wipes are pretty pleasant. After a few minutes of scrubbing and buffing, the scratch was almost impossible to see without you looking for it in the perfect light. I then brought the watch to the sink with the tape still on and gently rinsed it off. After, I removed the tape and gently washed the watch with dish soap. After drying the watch and putting the bracelet back on, I must say Iâ€™m very impressed. This product works very well at fading away light scratches.

Patrick G.,"I collect watches and sometimes a polished bracelet or case will get scuffed from wear. I have heard wonderful things about Cape Cod Polishing Clothes so I thought I would give it a try. I with I had thought to do some before and after on the most dramatic difference. One of my dive watches has a polished bracelet that was terribly scratched from use. After using the product, I would not say like new results, but really darn close. You get a lot of mileage out of these. Cut a small piece of a cloth and use some elbow (or thumb) grease and the scratches and scuffs fade and the shine comes back.  The only caution you need to be aware of is that this is for polishing polished surfaces only. If you have a watch or jewelry that has brushed and polished surfaces, make sure you take a few moments to take off the brushed surfaces. I have only used this on stainless steel so I cannot speak to other materials. But this is a great value for money and you will be pleased with the results.",5.0,2023-10-09,United State

Mikhail,"Couple of words about myself before the review. I am an engineer and jewelry making is my hobby over the last 35 years. I do all my fabrications from scratch making my own wire and sheet metal. In the past, I have ordered custom tools to be made to my specifications such as machined steel anvil, roller mill, mandrels and etc.

I am pleasingly surprised by this mandrel and the following is my review:

1). The surface is very well machined. Likely it was not subjected to the surface grinding, and lathe was the last tool touching it, but nevertheless it is more than acceptable. The surface is not over polished and edges are crisp.

2). Both ends are flat. Nice knurl on the handle and good blackened finish.

3). Quite accurate ring size markings (almost as good as on my Pepe mandrel). My digital caliper (with 0.01 mm precision) gave me readings about 0.1 mm less for each size than sizes published on Rio Grande site. I recommend to use sandpaper of 1000 grit to go over marking engravings to remove the edges on the engravings before usage. Markings become less visible but it is OK, because you do not want to transfer them to the inner surface of your ring.

4). I like that it was made from non-stainless steel which might be hardened to a higher degree on Rockwell Scale (HRC) than stainless steel. But unfortunately, the seller did not publish the hardness range in HRC. I hope it is hardened but I do not know at which extent. Only time and usage will show if it was hardened enough. I will try to update my review in 6 months.

5). It came nicely  packaged in special plastic container which could be used for long term storage. There was some grease (sufficient) on the surface to prevent rust. I would recommend to use rubbing alcohol to remove factory grease and apply light oil to prevent rusting like you must regularly use on your all other tools - roller mills, anvils, pliers and etc.

6). Price is more than reasonable - only $18

Please, ignore negative reviews where people were complaining about bad smell grease (all factory used rust inhibitors will have some smell), claiming inaccurate markings by using plastic ring measuring band or cheap ring sizer sets which are very inaccurate on it's own, or people hitting the mandrel with the steel hammer and complaining of marred surface. Also, there is no lead in the steel mandrel is made of or the plastic packaging - please, use a little bit of common sense.

Hope it was helpful.",5.0,2025-01-17,United State
nerak1051,"For jewelry makers of rings, this is a must have. It is quite heavy, solid steel and well marked. It even comes in it's own plastic case. It makes ring sizing easy!",5.0,2025-03-14,United State
RobS,"It MIGHT be a little off on the size but I'm not sure and frankly, I can't see how that matters all that much if you're using it for yourself, and I just don't see how you can check.

After all, when you first get this, you're probably going to do EXACTLY what I did: grab a ring that comfortably fits the finger you're thinking about and you were told the size of and stick it on there so you know where on the mandrel you want to size a ring to. But that's the problem, isn't it?

I mean, the whole purpose of getting one of these for yourself is because, as we all know: one jeweler's size 7 is another's 6.5 or 7.5 anyway so you may have been TOLD that was a 7 when you bought it but... is it REALLY? I mean, how can you honestly tell that the jeweler who swore to you that comfortable ring was a 7 wasn't ACTUALLY selling 7.5's the entire time? So, how in the heck do you know?

Alas, as I've come to rediscover recently, women's jewelry is just like our clothes: you think you MIGHT be around a size whatever but, really? It's just about anybody's guess what the heck the maker was thinking when they slapped on that number. This is why when I saw this inexpensive item here on Amazon, I decided that I was done with all of that mucking about and hit the Buy button.

Anyway, it's solidly built, highly affordable, and it works so it has been an awesome addition to my toolbox that I honestly should have gotten LONG ago.

It arrived well packed, wrapped and oiled and about 30 minutes after it's arrival, all the rings that were always a little tight were fitting perfectly. And, when I think about all of the time I wasted looking for jewelers that could size up a ring just a little for me or all of those years of putting up with them being too tight, I cannot honestly believe that it took me so damned long to get one of these things.

The guessing games are a long last over with because now I know that if I grab a 7 (or maybe it's been a 7.5 all these years) and I get a 6.5 (or maybe THOSE have been the 7's all along), it doesn't matter anymore. Either way, no matter what the &#34;truth&#34; is, if the darned thing doesn't quite fit, it'll only take a minute or two for me to fix that as soon as I get home.

Every woman in the damned world who wears rings should have one of these tucked away somewhere. If diamonds (or any other stone for that matter) are a girl's best friend, then this thing is your second!

te,"When I first looked at the mandrel I liked what I saw. It was clearly marked and was very nice. Then I started to measure rings. I found that the markings were rough and not easy to get good readings from. I decided to use 1000 grit wet or dry paper on the mandrel to try to reduce the roughness. It worked fairly well. the markings are not quite as clear as before, but they are just fine and easy to read. More important, is the fact that now when I slide a ring onto the mandrel, it goes smoothly up to it's size marking. I am now very happy with this purchase.",4.0,2024-09-24,United State

S. Dixon,"I purchased this item, unsure of what I would end up getting.  The mandrel arrived on time, and I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box.  This mandrel is well made, and substantial.  Now, upon opening the box, I noticed it was in a plastic sleeve, so being a true knuckle-draggers wife, I just picked it up and removed the plastic sleeve.  Sounds okay so far, right? Oh no!  I was anything but okay.  The mandrel is covered in a thin layer of oil.  Just keep that in mind when you open the box and remove it from the plastic sleeve.  The mandrel is coated in a thin layer of oil, which is there to protect the steel from rusting.  As my husband laughingly told me long AFTER THE FACT! Makes perfect sense for the oil to be there if you think about it, but at the time common sense was somewhere on vacation, and my thought processes where not fully functional.

Keep in mind, the oil is not a bad thing at all, and something I should have expected. So with that said, I managed to get oil all over my hands. This is of course the one time I couldn't find a napkin, paper towel, or tea-towel.  All I can say is ""Thank goodness for the dog!""  That's a joke kids. :o)

However, I did find it interesting how difficult turning doorknobs with your elbows can be while trying to get to the bathroom, at the other end of the house, to wash my hands; of course this is also the time when the phone starts ringing and someone is knocking on the front door, the dogs are going crazy, all the while my four year old is following me around asking me what happened to my hands and why am I trying to open the doors with my elbows, along with about a hundred other questions completely unrelated to the event.

But I digress.  This product is weighty, and extremely well made.  Just to be sure on accuracy, I sized my wedding rings, and my husband's rings on it, and they measured correctly on this mandrel.  Great product!  Just mind the protective coating of oil, and make sure you have a paper towel or something on hand, or you may have a Calgon moment like I did. :o)

Bubs,"I recently purchased the Ring Sizer Measuring Tool, and I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer for me as a jewelry enthusiast. This reusable finger size gauge has made my life so much easier when it comes to buying and creating jewelry.

First and foremost, the range of sizes it offers, from 1 to 17 USA ring sizes, is incredibly versatile. I no longer have to guess my ring size when shopping online or trying to create custom jewelry for friends and family. This tool allows for precise measurements, ensuring a perfect fit every time.

The durability of this ring sizer is impressive. It's made from high-quality materials that feel sturdy and long-lasting. I've used it repeatedly, and it still looks brand new. It's certainly a reliable investment for anyone who frequently deals with rings.

One of the best features is its reusability. Unlike disposable plastic ring sizers, this tool is eco-friendly and cost-effective in the long run. It's a small step towards sustainability, and I appreciate that.

The Ring Sizer Measuring Tool is also incredibly user-friendly. The sizes are clearly marked and easy to read, making the measurement process a breeze. I've even used it to help friends and family find their ring sizes, and they were equally impressed by its simplicity and accuracy.

In summary, this reusable finger size gauge has become an indispensable tool in my jewelry collection. Its versatility, durability, eco-friendliness, and ease of use make it a must-have for anyone who loves jewelry. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all jewelry enthusiasts, crafters, and shoppers alike. It's a small investment that makes a big difference.",5.0,2023-10-05,United State

Larry,"This is an ingenious and simple tape measure that is particularly easy to use.

Once the free end of the tape is extended around the body part of interest and inserted into its notched holder, a simple button press will apply just enough tension to take up any slack in a consistent and repeatable manner. Then and pressing the â€˜Ejectâ€™ button, releases this free end of the tape, keeping its exact length in place, and the measurement can then be read.

The accuracy of these circumference measurements can quickly be verified by using any available cylinder a few inches or larger in diameter. Simply measure its diameter (either in inches or cm) as accurately as possible then multiply this value by pi (or 3.14); this will be the exact circumference of the cylinder. Now use the Reidea tape to measure the same circumference and compare values. They should be virtually identical.

Further, problems of the tapeâ€™s free end hook breaking off can easily be prevented by simply holding the free end of the tape while itâ€™s being retracted â€“ simply, just donâ€™t let this free end, uncontrollably, retract into its case at full speed. Most of these complaints of breakage, I strongly suspect, are user-related errors and not design flaws with this device.",5.0,2024-03-24,United State

Lana W.,"Time saver. This thing is awesome that it saves so much time. At the same time, this really only solves a 1st world problem. LOL. But cool gadget through, especially if youâ€™re measuring yourself constantly because you keep gaining and losing weight. The pin that holds the little nipple in place is small. Hopefully itâ€™ll hold up to constant use. The only bad thing about this measurer is that it does take up quite a bit of space.

If you do this for a living, then this is a great time saver. But if you're like me that does this as a hobby and only sew once a week (at most), it's really takes up more valuable space than needed.",4.0,2023-08-12,United State
Moe,"I have not compared the measurements I got with another source...there are other reviewers that did so you can read their review for that info. My review is based on ease of use.

It is easy(ish) to get your own measurements but it takes a little extra work on your part.

1. The tab that hooks in slides out REALLY easily so you have to hold that in place while using another finger or hand to click the button to bring the tape taut.

2. If you just unhook it and bring it up to read the measurement there is a chance you wont get an accrete measurement because part of the tape may slip back inside. To solve this once you have the tape where you want it you have to press your finger on the tape where it comes out and hold that in place while you unhook it and bring it up to read the measurement to assure you are getting a correct reading.

While these are two things I wish they would correct to make getting body measurements easier I can work around them.",4.0,2020-07-21,United State

The smart measuring tape device connects easily to the Arboleaf app, which then syncs to Apple Health.

The Arboleaf app functions well is very intuitive to use.  This is important because without the Arboleaf app, the measuring tape device would not have any 'smart' functions.

SC,"I've been using the RENPHO Smart Scale for a few weeks now while on the carnivore diet, and itâ€™s been a fantastic tool for tracking my progress. The scale is incredibly easy to set up, syncing seamlessly with the RENPHO app via Bluetooth. The VA display is clear and easy to read, which I appreciate during my morning weigh-ins.

What stands out the most is the range of metrics it tracks. Besides weight, it measures body fat, muscle mass, and even water percentage, giving me a comprehensive view of how my body is responding to the carnivore diet. Iâ€™ve noticed that while my weight has remained stable, my body fat percentage has steadily decreased, and my muscle mass has increased, which is exactly what I was hoping for.

The scale's accuracy seems on point, and the app provides easy-to-read charts that show my progress over time. Being able to see these detailed metrics helps me stay motivated and ensures that my diet is having the intended effect.

JaxBiz,"For the price, itâ€™s a nice sleek scale. The weight is accurate and it updates an app on my phone. The app connects to the health settings of my iPhone, so itâ€™s nice to have all my data in one place. Itâ€™s hard to imagine that any scale From $30-$120 can accurately determine your body fat percentage, bone density, or muscle mass. I believe that to be the case with this scale. It takes your height and weight and makes its own determination of what your fat or muscle % may be. During the last two months, itâ€™s obvious that I have lost fat weight and gained muscle, but the scale does not reflect that. I use a much more expensive machine at the gym to get a body fat percentage and my scale at home is off by 100%.  The $10,000 machine at the gym tells me my body fat is 9%, whereas this scale tells me itâ€™s 18. I am definitely not 18% body fat. For people who are looking to build muscle, I would not rely on the scale to measure it accurately. Or for people who are gaining muscle and losing fat weight, I would not rely on this scale for that either.
I did not expect this scale to be accurate for body fat or muscle mass, so I am not upset with the purchase. I was strictly looking for a scale to measure my weight and update it on my phone. This skill does that so Iâ€™m happy.",4.0,2025-03-21,United State

I already had the app because of my humidifier (one of the reasons I went with this brand) and setup was super easy. Another reason I chose this particular scale is because I liked the look of the display and things I could see without needing to look in the app.

Julianna Dawson,"I love that my Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale is a great tool in my kitchen to help me measure food to ensure that I track what Iâ€™m putting into my body, my husband's and my childrenâ€™s bodies each and every day, all day! It helps me measure food and ensure the quality control on everything. This food scale is my constant companion. I donâ€™t eat without it. Now, donâ€™t get me wrong. I didn't always use a food scale to measure my food intake. In fact, for years when I heard people talk about using a food scale, and measuring their food intake it was always dieters, and one thing I never went on was a diet. At least not in the sense I understood they meant to use the word, ""diet""! The thought of depriving my body from food was foreign to me. In fact, growing up with a limited food supply meant that once I was old enough to get a job, I exiled food shortage from my life. However, overeating because food became plentiful in adulthood with a job eventually became a problem. Especially after pregnancy and becoming a mother. An experience worth losing a few vanity points over for sure! However, with weight gain vanity concerns pale in comparison to health concerns. You see, I needed to know for sure that I was eating what my body needed, and that I was feeding my husband and children what their bodies needed. And, if I began to tip over to overeating, I wanted it to be a conscious choice! And for my husband and children, I wanted to help them learn when to recognize that they were tipping over the point of eating the recommended daily calories from each food group so that I and so that they had awareness of when they had enough to do the job of sustaining a thriving body so we could experience the whole life change we were after as a family. This Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale plays a big part of helping us do that. All day, every day. It makes it easy. It takes just a second to put the food on it and measure the serving size. And I get to choose the units (ounces, grams, etc.).

Now, I don't know about you, but I LOVE observing how people who work for companies in a support capacity do their jobs. And when I come across a person or staff that wows me, I stop and take notice! I also stop and take notice when I come across staff that has the opposite effect on me. And my follow through is just as thorough then as this review is now. The Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale support team wowed me! Immediately they responded to my inquiry when my scale, which I had for a long time, stopped working one day. Like I told you, this thing works hard all day every day measuring food for a family of four. Well, their support team instructed me on how to troubleshoot what was the cause of the problem, offered to send me a new scale, which arrived quickly, AND the piece de resistance. Several weeks later, they reached out to me to ask me how the new scale was working. Talk about a customer support team! Now that's the kind of service I want all day every day!

So, if you're considering buying a food scale for yourself and/or your family, I highly recommend the Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale. Not just because it's an amazing digital piece of machinery, but because the company has people, actual human beings who work there that care about the service they provide customers and it shows in the CRM (customer relationship management) system they very likely automated utilizing the beauty of digital technology to do it, but they also kept the human element present with their service, which gives them an extra edge.

This is my third Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale! It's a machine. It isn't meant to last forever. All machines eventually stop working. There's an expected life for every machine. And when this machine serves me till it can't anymore, like the last 2 did, I'll gratefully whisper a thank you for your service to the people who made it and gladly buy another one. Year after year. Etekcity and their customer team now have a ""raving fan"", as one of my favorite teachers and mentors calls it! When you get yours, let me know if you become a raving fan of the Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale too.",5.0,2022-09-01,United State

So I already had the app and knew I wanted to try and find the scale through the app on Amazon before purchasing on their website. I knew I wanted to stick with their product because I know their stuff is extremely accurate! With that being said, time to talk about the actual food scale!

I started a weight loss journey a couple days ago. Iâ€™ve tried before but I never got serious about it. Iâ€™d try working out and a diet but would fail after 5 days. This time Iâ€™ve come into it with the best mindset. So when I knew I wanted to do portion control, I wanted to get a scale to help me fully understand the amount of calories Iâ€™m in taking every day because the whole calorie thing never made sense to me and it was hard to track using a pen and paper. Iâ€™m still trying to learn more about the other things beside calories which Iâ€™m hoping with the help of the scale, Iâ€™ll be able to do that. But I donâ€™t want to get consumed by counting my calories so i thought, okay letâ€™s get a scale to do it for me! So I went with this one!

First glance, the quality of the product is absolutely amazing! It comes with battery which I was completely shocked by. Itâ€™s made well! I love the size and Iâ€™m so excited to fully get to use it. I had a mini slim Jim next to me so I went ahead and tested it out using that and it did give me different numbers than the box, but i genuinely believe the scale more than the box. Iâ€™ve seen multiple people say the box gives bigger numbers than actual whatâ€™s in the product. Itâ€™s worth every penny!

The first time I used it, I was meal-prepping chicken and rice, and I was shocked how easy it was to log everything. You just place the food on the scale, open the app, and it gives you the full breakdownâ€”no guessing, no Googling.

The stainless steel design looks sleek and is super easy to clean. Itâ€™s accurate, quick, and the 11lb limit is perfect for anything from small snacks to full meals. Whether youâ€™re cutting, bulking, or just trying to eat smarter, this scale makes nutrition tracking way simpler.

awilli9004,"These measuring tapes have become a must-have in my crafting kit, and hereâ€™s why:

This set includes two tape measuresâ€”one is a 60-inch soft pink tape measure, and the other is a retractable black tape measure with double scales. Both are incredibly versatile and perfect for different purposes. The pink one is great for body measurements and is flexible enough to use for fabric and sewing projects, while the retractable black tape is easy to carry around for measuring things like home decor, knitting projects, or even for my weight loss progress.

Both tape measures feature clear, easy-to-read markings in both inches and centimeters, which makes them incredibly convenient for any kind of project. Whether Iâ€™m sewing, knitting, or tracking my body measurements, the numbers are precise and well-printed, making the measuring process smooth and accurate every time.

The pink soft tape is flexible and feels durable yet comfortable, perfect for fitting around the body. Itâ€™s also made of a high-quality material that doesnâ€™t fray or stretch out over time, making it a great tool for long-term use. The retractable black tape is very sturdy, and the retracting mechanism works flawlessly, giving it great longevity for various uses.

As someone who enjoys sewing and crafts, I love how this set covers all my measuring needs. Additionally, the flexibility of the soft tape makes it easy to use for tracking body measurements, whether for tailoring or tracking weight loss progress. Itâ€™s handy to have both options, and they work well for different situations.

For two high-quality measuring tapes, the price is more than reasonable. You get a soft, flexible tape for body measurements and a retractable one for other tasks. The two-pack offers excellent value and convenience.",5.0,2024-12-04,United State

BP,"Finally started using this unit in the last week as my Kletop finally ran out.

First point of frustration is the plastic guard over the cleaning top - I don't care for it, but this isn't the primary issue for the low review score.

The main issue is that the spring & gearing on the unit is garbage. When you push the window open to clean a fiber, it doesn't always catch, so sometimes the cleaning material gets completely refreshed, other times it might only move it 1/4 or 1/2 way, so you have to cycle it again to hopefully get a fully refreshed cleaning surface. Additionally, the spring that pushes the lever back doesn't typically get it all the way back, so it adds another step to pull the lever back to 'home' after each time you use it.

All of this behavior started within the first handful of uses, and after having to clean over a hundred fiber pairs on this last build, this thing almost got thrown into the nearest corn field just so no one would have to use it again.",1.0,2024-09-26,United State

I was able to reliably strip fiber optical cables to install dozens of fiber optic terminations.  The three holes/notches aligned perfectly to the size of my cable to allow clean stripping of the outer sheathing, inner sheathing, and acrylic coating on the core fiber.  In contrast, I was only able to get about 30 or 40% reliability stripping with the two-hole stripper that came with my cheap installation kit.

Kevin H. Patterson,"These strippers have worked perfectly for me on both single and multimode fiber. I didn't have to adjust my pair at all, unlike some of the other reviews. (The only minor problem I had has been stripping off the cladding of some bare fiber in very cold outdoor conditions (near freezing), breaking the fiber while trying to strip. However, I think this is more due to the fiber being more brittle in the cold; when I warmed it up it worked fine without breaking. The only other thing I can think of is maybe the metal of the tool contracts enough from the cold to make the stripping too tight. In any case, work in a room-temperature environment or warm things up and you should be fine.) I have had the best success holding the tool at about 45 degrees relative to the fiber, instead of directly perpendicular to it. Would definitely recommend this tool and  buy it again if needed.

Jamilla J.,"I'm a scrapper like I said. So my use for this item is very specific. I need to strip the whole jacket off of wires of many different gauges and lengths. Strictly longitudinal cuts is my game. I go through ALOT of wire on a daily basis. A couple hundred dollars of wire a day. It's taken me A LONG time and miles and miles of wire to get to this point in my dumpster diving/ recycling career. Over the last year I have bought 5 different wire strippers to help me with this task. I'm really handy with a hawkbill knife but my hands get pretty tired sometimes and occasionally I have alot to get done in a very short period of time before the scrap yard closes so I've been looking for sometime that is CONSISTENTLY fast to use for wire of any size or length.  This one looked like it had potential but missed the mark.

  First off the instructions that it comes with are literally garbage. The worst BROKEN English translation I have ever seen. Lucky for me I'm more than just a pretty face and this ain't my first wire stripper so I was able to figure out the operation pretty easily. Getting the blade depth set is very tricky. I don't understand why the depth is set with the knob and the screw it should be one or the other. Also the knob turns way to easily. It would be great if you could set the depth with the screw and then tighten the knob to lock it in the same place. All too often once the depth is set and I start attempting to pull it the knob unavoidably gets turned by my hand so the blade backs off and stops cutting all together. Lime I said getting the depth set is very tricky because the adjuster knob is very sensitive.  You have to readjust the blade every time your starting a new peice of wire. Finding the happy medium between not cutting through v.s. cutting in way too deep and getting stuck is time consuming and frustratingly inconsistent. Another big issue for me is  that you have to have tension in the wire ilike by anchoring the end of instead of being able to set it and pull down the length of wire with one hand. The other main detraction is the inability to strip a variety of sizes of wire. I need to be able to strip smaller gauges as well as larger.",3.0,2022-04-01,United State
William white,"Blades last long as well as you get it set right, easy to take care of, and works as well as you can use it.  Thereâ€™s a tiny learning curve in terms of adjusting it, but I got the hang of it in around 15 minutes.

Robert,"I am an electrician specializing in remodel projects, so I am always pulling out old wire and recycling it.  I have thought about getting a stripping machine for a while, but always thought I needed a big and expensive one.  I finally broke down and thought I would give one of these smaller ones a try, and like others have said: why didn't I get one of these years ago?!  It works well, and strips wire much faster than I could with a utility knife, and much safer, too.

The unit is small, but that is a plus, not a minus.  It is well built, with good milling of the solid aluminum frame and moving parts that fit tight but move easily.  I bolted mine down to a small block of wood just big enough to hold it and the drill to run it.  I can then clamp the unit to a work bench or stand, and easily store the assembly away when I am done with it.

I will say that it can be a little finicky.  Although the feed angle is not super-critical, it does matter for how well the material feeds through and, if set poorly, can cause the wire to slip to the side of the cutter wheel.  Also, stripping smaller stranded wire (so far in the #14 - #12 range, I haven't tried others yet) requires much more accuracy with the cutting wheel, otherwise you end up with a lot of copper slivers as the wheel will cut the strands as well as the insulation.  However, it doesn't take a lot to fine tune the adjustments, and once set, it runs really well.  Therefore, any other reviewers stating they are having trouble with the wire not staying under the cutting wheel is simply not paying attention to their setup.

Although I would not consider this is to be a production stripper, I have managed to strip thousands of feet of wire in just a couple of days.  There are a couple of things this little stripper will struggle with, such as stripping the outer jacket of round multi-wire (aka 3-wire plus ground) cables, but again, with a little but of tweaking, it took me less than a minute to set up and strip over 100' of 12/3 that was probably made in the 70's or 80's, which has a much thicker jacket and a lot more paper filler inside, so it was quite a challenge.  Once the inside wires were separated, I was able to just run individual wire after wire, and a couple of minutes later, I had several more pounds of bare copper in the pile.

Overall, in a couple of days I will have finished what would have taken me weeks to do, plus I will get more money per pound for the stripped wire than if I didn't strip it, so this little unit has pretty much paid for itself in no time.  If you are in the market for stripping a fair amount of wire, but not looking to make a living out of it (need a bigger machine for that), this little unit will certainly do the trick.",5.0,2020-10-24,United State
Mike. O,I just purchased the strip Meister wire shipping machine. I attach a battery powered drill to the Arbor. It works a lot better than stripping the wire in a vice. It works very well. The biggest thing is learning how to adjust the settings. That was fairly easy to do. Most of the wire I strip is 14 to 10 gauge wire. I have stripped some heavier wire though. so far I have stripped about $300 worth of copper wire. Well worth the investment.,5.0,2024-12-31,United State

Richard Burke,"Following the use of several cheaper wire strippers that demonstrated limited lifespan, I opted to try this model, which had garnered excellent reviews. Through further research, I discovered that multiple reviewers praised its capability to strip 18 AWG, with some reviewers even achieving success with 22 AWG. Having stripped approximately 250-300 pounds of copper with this tool, primarily consisting of 18 and 16 AWG fire wire, I can attest to its remarkable performance. I have also successfully stripped hundreds of feet of 10 and 12 AWG wire with remarkable ease. To enhance its functionality, I modified the tool to incorporate a foot pedal, which has proven to be highly beneficial. This feature enables me to feed and guide the wire with one hand while removing the insulation with the other. I have found that this tool is particularly effective for stripping wire gauges 18-2, 16-2, and 14-2. By adjusting the settings, I have been able to strip the outer jacket and most of the inner conductors simultaneously. I highly recommend this tool and strongly advise reading the instructions carefully to ensure optimal results. This investment has already paid for itself tenfold.",5.0,2024-12-01,United State

John Wayne Walker II,"Don't waste your money on other brands. Watch some video reviews or side-by-side comparisons if you aren't sure. I was given a wire stripper by a friend that's another brand. The center cutting wheel has an adjustment with hex nuts, but it has a small amount of play/give. You might strip 15 or 20 feet of wire, then the wheel slips to the side and you gotta recalibrate. Stripmeister's center wheel has no adjustment, b/c it is not needed. The wheel needs to be stationary as far as left-right movement is concerned. Stripmeister is like a miracle of engineering compared to the others. Thankfully my other stripper machine was given to me for free after the guys father passed away. So i didnt buy it.

Gary Petersen,"Likes: E1000 Electric Automatic Wire Stripper Machine is highly capable of stripping straight, larger diameter cable. It makes a clean cut on both sides of the insulation of the 1"" copper cable I have been reclaiming. The variable speed feeder system is a great feature, which can be dialed for maximum benefit to the user based on the cable length and  weight. The new feeder wheel technology positively grips the cable insulation far better than cable strippers of other brands. The 1/2 HP variable speed Motor coupled with a precision gear box and a PWM variable speed controller delivers high torque and precise adjustable cutting speeds, and operates at a cool temperature even with a heavy workload. The drive system is an absolute must for folks stripping a lot of large diameter cable. The StripMeister video guides are extremely helpful.
Dislikes: The stripper cutting wheel has a tendency to roll off center on larger diameter cable if the cable is not perfectly straight, with the cable wanting to leave the center low-point groove on the the drive. This leaves a cut in the insulation that does not expose the the copper wire. However, a proper adjustment of the vertical guide and and slowing the speed down seems to resolve this problem.",4.0,2022-05-02,United State

Kawasaki rider,"I bought this because as an industrial electrician I had a lot of wire I had accumulated from various jobs. This thing will pay for itself quickly. To put it in perspective, I trimmed wires for 3 days (about 12 hours total) by hand and I managed to trim 24 pounds of 2 awg thhn wire. This thing trimmed over 75lbs in just a little over three hours and I did it while watching tv and that is including unboxing and setting it up. One thing I will say is read all the instructions. I did not move the wheel in so the wire wanted to roll and not cut down the middle. Operator error. Had it not been for that I believe the time wouldâ€™ve been less but regardless I was able to trim a 100lbs of wire and my hands donâ€™t hurt. Beats the heck out of doing it with a razor blade or knife. If you have big wire or even small wire and you are wanting to trim it to get the most buck for your copper buy this machine! My only complaint is I wish the manufacturer would just use thumb screws instead of hex cap (Allen head) bolts as this wouldâ€™ve made changing the plates for bigger wire easier. However the machine comes with the proper Allen wrenches to make the necessary adjustments. I hope it last a long time. I feel like it should as it feels very durable.",5.0,2024-02-06,United State

LFM,"tl;dr:  Big, heavy, works.  Butt connectors are solid and above average.

This is a big, heavy pair of crimpers, and it does the job well.  The ratcheting works reliably, and releases easily (so far, at least!).  I definitely appreciate that it seems made to be disassembled and serviced, too -- if it gets stuck or corroded, it should be possible to take it apart, clean it, lube it, and reassemble it.

The butt joints are great.  The are larger and more sturdy than the cheap ones you usually find in local car parts stores / etc.

At the same time, this kit's strengths are also kind of its weaknesses:  The crimper is large -- if you're working in a tight space (like marine wiring, or behind / under teh dash in a car, etc, with limited slack on the wires, say) it could be tough to make it all fit and work.  And it's heavy -- you're probably not going to want to toss it in your toolbag ""just in case"", but it'll be handy to have in a shop cabinet.

Similarly, the butt joints are great... but that's all you get.  No other types of crimp-on connector.  Not that any are promised, of course, but I could see this kit being more useful if there were a variety.

It arrives in a very plain, but sturdy and well padded box, and the connector organizer box seems like it should stand up to use -- but it seals with a ""push close"" top instead of actual latches... might not be trustworthy tossed in a box that's driven around / etc.

There are tons of these kits floating here on Amazon, and it's going to come down to a shopper's personal choice on what provides the most use for the dollar... personally, I might spend the same amount for a crimper that comes with different dies or other accessories instead of a bunch of butts, but if you need the butts, this kit is a nice deal.

Hard to make a star call on this one:  It works, well, but not quite as well with smaller, cheaper terminals, and the included terminals are nice, but only one type.  Maybe a 4.5 would fit, but that's not an option, soooo... no real faults, but since it's not above-and-beyond awesome or a shockingly great value, let's go four stars.

Please make sure you are using good crimpers and know how to crimp correctly or you may have problems. If your crimps are coming loose then that is usually user error.

J. Kelley,"This set is great.  Itâ€™s more connectors than most people will ever use on a single project.  The sizes included are pretty much standard.  These connectors have a longer shrink portion, but a smaller crimp section than more â€œpremiumâ€ brands of marine heat shrink connectors such as Anchor.

Iâ€™ve included some pictures for comparison next to a similarly size/gauge Ancor marine heat shrink connector.  As you can see in the pictures, the metal portion of the Ancor brand is about twice as thick. This makes it much harder to crimp, but also much harder to accidentally uncrimp I suppose.  Thereâ€™s much more shrink on this set of connector.  On a per connector basis, the premium brand is probably 50x more expensive too.

Iâ€™ve used a bunch of these for non critical circuits, they go on and hold up completely fine.  Even in a salt water environment.  Iâ€™ll still continue to use a more premium connector on critical circuits, due to the thickness of the metal itself",4.0,2023-06-05,United State

Nicholas,"These connectors did work for me, but I ran into a few problems.  This is coming from a weekend warrior; not a electrical veteran.

First, and this isn't necessarily a problem with the product, but important for customers to know: a hair dryer will not work; period.  We have a very high temperature, high power one here that I thought would work with some patience; it didn't make a dent.  I had to order a heat gun and use it on a high settings to even begin shrinkage.  So factor that into your cost analysis.

Second, I assumed electrical connectors were standard sizes, and that I could trust the measurements given.  Unfortunately, none of the yellow connectors fit into my PSU's terminals except the male spades, and there wasn't nearly enough room for the terminal screw to go through that (since that's not really what they're for).  In the end I didn't use the connectors, I attached the bare wire, which made my purchase of these pointless.  I measured the size of my PSU's terminals at 3/8"" and this kit includes 1/4"" connectors, but that's an internal diameter; this may be standard, but I wish the description had included something about this for beginners.

But here is my big complaint: the wire sizes are wrong.  I tried to use a blue butt connector to connect an 18 awg wire to a 22 awg wire.  They didn't fit.  I had to use a yellow to attach them.  And I couldn't fit my 10 awg wire into the yellow butt joint at all.  This caused a serious problem for me and set me back quite a bit.

However, the connectors held well once installed and the heat shrink worked as expected.  The heat shrink material seemed sturdy and I had no problems with tearing.  In the end I was able to get the job done (although without connectors for my PSU.",4.0,2019-05-28,United State
Nobody Special,"Have not had the chance to use them yet, will update the review after use and after some time has passed.  I did want to note that the connector assortment kit appears to be nicely stocked and organized.  The case and contents appear to be good quality and do not feel or look ""cheap"".  You will note in my first photo an example of the size of the kit and case compared to a fishing/tackle organizer (the size I was expecting), and an inexpensive heat-shrink assortment kit (pretty close to the size I usually receive assortment kits in).  This kit is not small.  While it was larger than I was expecting (not going to fault them or amazon for that - I never bothered to check the size as it wasn't important in my selection of this kit), it is not so large as to be oddly-sized or inconvenient (I have a few other kits and organizers of the same size).  It is a good size, especially for the number and types of connectors included.

I was also nicely surprised when I discovered that Wirefy had also included a detailed, illustrated, and color-coded list of the kit contents, complete with the part numbers and quantities included.  This should make it much easier to order components when the need to restock the kit arrives.

Bill or Sparkey,"The thing I like the most about these crimp connectors, they have a crimping tool that is related to them. Unfortunately, not all of these crimp connectors are completely waterproof / water resistance. The heat shrink material does not completely cover the electrical connection. That's the only reason why I gave it a 3. However, they are far better than the non-shrink types out there. I do a lot of trailer light repair on the side, {horse trailers, boat trailers, various farm equipment and etc}. Most of them get abuse due to the elements they are in. Most of the lighting issues is from corrosion in the connections in the wiring. It is tedious to use a non-shrink crimp with separate shrink material. Getting the right size is the headache. This is a major benefit with these connectors as the heat shrink and crimp connect are combine together, crimp n shrink. Cuts out half the time. There has been several good comments about the heat shrink binding to the wire's insulation. This will help with vibration on the connection point, preventing wire breakage.

dragonlord,"This crimping tool has quickly become a staple in my DIY toolkit. This ratcheting wire crimper is incredibly efficient, providing a secure and reliable crimp every time. The ratcheting mechanism ensures consistent pressure, making it easy to achieve professional-quality crimps without much effort.

One of the standout features is the ergonomic design. The handles are comfortable and reduce hand fatigue, even during extended use. The tool is well-constructed and feels durable, which gives me confidence that it will last through many projects. The adjustable crimping pressure is also a great feature, allowing for precise adjustments based on the connector size and type.

The only minor downside is that it takes a bit of practice to get the hang of the ratcheting mechanism, but once you do, it makes the crimping process much more efficient and consistent.

Michael C.,"So I first purchased a Titan 11950 7pc crimper set. I have used it quite a bit and really really like it. I had also purchased a couple of extra dies and needed some other that were not specifically offered by/for the Titan. That is how I found the Wirefy product line. I bought 7 additional Wirefy dies and the 9â€ crimper handle. I was initially concerned if the dies would interchange with the Titan crimper. They seem to interchange without issue. I have not performed many crimps with them,  yet it seems so far to be a good addition. I bought the crimper handle to add an additional to my tool box and to have the heavier duty option. It feels good in the hand and operates smoothly. It would be an excellent addition to any tool kit. With all of my new found dies and the additional frame I had outgrown my original blow molded case. I upgraded to a Plano 3500 series box. Plano model number 2375002. It is a clear plastic box most often associated with fishing tackle. The one I chose has a wide section at the bottom that accommodates the crimper frames (both fit and the lid closes) as well as all of the dies I now have. There is not a space for each individual die set but it is very manageable. I mention this because there was some question as to if the case that Wirefy offers would accommodate the larger frame.

Lastly I included a photo of the Titan frame, the 9â€ Wirefy frame and my older Paladin 1300 crimper. I read in another review that the 9â€ was the same as the Paladin with the exception of the quick change feature. My particular model is not as such and is a closer match to the Titan frame. The grips are quite a bit beefier and seem far more comfortable than the Paladin tool.

Gary Lofgren,"I have previously always used rolls of heat shrink for my automotive wiring work to provide extra protection to wire connections. This kit has been a great time saver by not having to worry about trimming lengths off a roll, I can just quickly grab the number of lengths that I need and go.

Trevor K Smith,"I recently purchased the Wirefy Heat Shrink Tubing Kit (180 PCS - 3:1 Ratio Adhesive Lined), and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. Here's a detailed review based on my experience:

### Comprehensive Kit
This kit includes 180 pieces of heat shrink tubing in seven different sizes ranging from 3/32"" to 3/4"". This variety ensures that I have the right size for any project, whether it's small electronics or larger cable repairs. The pieces are precut to 3.5 inches, which is very convenient for quick applications&#8203;:citation[oaicite:6]{index=6}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:5]{index=5}&#8203;.

### Superior Shrink Ratio
The 3:1 shrink ratio is particularly impressive. It recovers to one-third of its original diameter, providing a snug and secure fit over various wire gauges. This feature eliminates the common issue of 2:1 tubing not shrinking tight enough, ensuring a professional and durable insulation every time&#8203;:citation[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;.

### Adhesive Lined for Extra Protection
What sets this kit apart is the adhesive lining inside the tubing. When heated, the adhesive melts and flows, creating a waterproof seal and providing excellent insulation. This feature is especially useful for automotive, marine, and outdoor applications where moisture resistance is crucial&#8203;:citation[oaicite:3]{index=3}&#8203;.

### Easy to Use
Using this heat shrink tubing is straightforward. Simply slide the tubing over the connection and apply heat with a heat gun. The tubing shrinks quickly and evenly, making it easy to achieve professional results even for beginners. The dual-wall construction adds extra durability, with the outer wall providing abrasion resistance and the inner wall creating a strong adhesive bond&#8203;:citation[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:1]{index=1}&#8203;.

### Excellent Value for Money
At $14.99, this kit offers great value. The quality of the tubing and the comprehensive selection of sizes make it a cost-effective solution for a wide range of electrical insulation tasks. Free expedited shipping and returns add to the overall value, making it a hassle-free purchase&#8203;:citation[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, the Wirefy Heat Shrink Tubing Kit is a high-quality, versatile product that meets all my electrical insulation needs. Its easy application, strong adhesive lining, and durable dual-wall construction make it a must-have for any DIY enthusiast or professional. I highly recommend this kit for anyone looking for reliable and effective heat shrink tubing.",5.0,2024-06-19,United State

This is unavoidable when round, thin tubing is wrapped around a spool, but it did make it challenging to pull cables through. Once the heat gun was applied, there was uniform shrink and fantastic adhesion. This gave me great confidence that my project was going to work out as planned.

J. Campbell,"Ordered the Â¾â€ shrink tube for a speaker wire application. I was running two strands of Amazon Basic 12AWG speaker wire and it was NOT easy to feed the wire through! The tube comes compressed and rolled making it very flat. The speaker wire was insulated and running two strands was going to prove to be very tough. After struggling for about 30 minutes I had an idea. I have a small air compressor in the garage I use for projects with an air gun attachment. I fed the two insulated wires in as far as they would go - about a foot - and then had my wife spray air down the roughly 7â€™ run of tubing as I shoved the wires down the tube. This took a long time but ultimately worked. I canâ€™t imagine any other way this would have worked. If youâ€™re just snipping off small sections this will work great! If youâ€™re running long runs like I was, just know you have a dayâ€™s work ahead of you!

I used a heat gun to shrink the tubing around the wires once fed all the way through and it shrunk to about half the size so Iâ€™d say the 2:1 shrink ratio is accurate. The inside of the tube has glue inside so nothing is moving around once shrunk down.

Very good product. I hope this review was helpful to you in some way. Cheers!",5.0,2024-05-12,United State

Cables work well for that, but I had this chain sitting around in my shop and thought, ""if it is good for bicycle chains, it should make for a good lockbox security cable.""  I had to come up with a way to keep the chain from damaging any porch rails around which it would wrap, so I decided to try shrink wrap.  I did not need the marine-grade, because I wanted to be able to remove the sleeve and replace it if that became necessary.  I found this particular roll at a fair price, so I decided to try it.  It measured 1-5/8"" flat, but keep in mind that is a FLAT measurement and the diameter measurement is how I ordered, which was 1"".  I used a heat gun to shrink it, and you can see by the pictures how well it came out.  When I shrank the tube, it kept its length while fitting around the chain links, so I was super happy about that.  Being concerned with the possibility of one of the chains rusting, I decided to spray WD40 into the tube and let it saturate the chain all the way down.  It did not seem to affect the tubing in any way.  I can't wait to see how this set up handles adverse weather.",5.0,2024-07-04,United State

LTFoReal,"Backstory: I just put up a metal Allen+Roth gazebo and my wife had some solar string lights that we wanted to put up. I didnâ€™t want to drill holes in it and have always had bad experiences with adhesive solutions to hold pc wires under my desk so I didnâ€™t want to have that happen on a bigger scale. Magnets seemed like the perfect solution and the black color on these along with rated strength sounded perfect.

Performance -
These things are strong, you wouldnâ€™t think that string lights would be too heavy but these had some pretty thick cables and I needed something that could hold up the bulbs without making me worry. So far these are doing the job exceedingly well.

Stability -
Due to the nature of magnets (not so much the products fault) they will slide around if mounted horizontally much easier than if mounted vertically. I found this out the hard way as it slid on me a few times. I readjusted them to hand more vertically and they have been solid since. They still well enough to aluminum that Iâ€™d have to give a decent pull for them to come off.

Hooks -
The hooks are blunt and while they looked smaller than I anticipated, they ended up being a perfect size for my needs. I think the worst part of the process was getting them all twisted in because I got 40 of them (10 for each side of the gazebo to be extra sure) but I didnâ€™t have any issues with the threading as others have mentioned. I did find it difficult in some cases to twist it as the coating can make it a bit slippery. Using gloves or your shirt for additional grip is enough to fix that.

Ease of removal -
With a little over natural degree of force you should be able to pull them off of an aluminum surface. It sticks hard but it should be strong enough to be impossible by any means. Sliding it sideways might make it easier too.

Overall -
Iâ€™ve only had it for one day but Iâ€™m confident that under normal conditions I wonâ€™t need to bother checking up on them. If I donâ€™t update with a complaint later after a storm or something more severe then assume that everything went fine. I tend to leave enough reviews that Iâ€™d remember to come back if thereâ€™s a problem. So far I highly recommend these and commend this company for making a great product at a reasonable price, thatâ€™s pretty rare these days.",5.0,2024-06-22,United State

Beard///,"I bought these in preparation for a cruise.  Room walls are metal, and itâ€™s a popular pro tip to bring some magnetic hooks for convenient additional storage.

I bought hooks meant to hold 30lbs.  When they came, the label clearly said they hold 25lbs.  I think thatâ€™s annoying, but generally fine for me.

I hadnâ€™t considered that the weight the magnet can hold is dependent on the angle/direction of the magnet.  So if gravity pulls everything down, you will be able to support heavier loads when hung from the ceiling.  When hung on the wall, as I suspect most will do, the load it can support is much less heavy.  For me, the 30lb hooks supported about 1lb of weight when applied to a cruise ship wall.  This was helpful, but less useful than I expected.  Have a hat, on it and not much more.

Cruise goers should opt for a much stronger magnet if they expect to hang a wet towel on these hooks.",3.0,2025-03-01,United State
golindaguy,"Letâ€™s start out by saying I love these hooks. I they have opened up a whole new frontier around here where I can hang things. Now theyâ€™re rated for a lot of weight, but that only applies when they are hanging down vertically. When you stick them on your refrigerator, and they stick out horizontally from the refrigerator side, they hold much less weight individually. However, as you can see from my photograph, you can reinforce them with more magnets without hooks, which are attached separately and come in the box separately, and then theyâ€™ll hold about anything. I love these things.",5.0,2025-02-26,United State
Kalli,"These are fairly strong for their size. They come in a compact package (YOU put it together!, like those old toy commercials used to say) and while most of them went together perfectly, some were only threaded partway, and one of those would not screw into the receptacle at all. But with 25 in a pack I'm sure I won't regret that one. And I can still use it as a magnet, even if not a hook.
They work well on the front of my fridge, which is polished stainless steel â€” one hook was sufficient for my cutting board â€” but I wanted to hang it on the side, so it wouldn't clank every time I opened the door. The sides have a textured finish and it requires three hooks to hold the cutting board on this surface. One held up my lighter with no problems, though.
I also took some to work to hang various spare keys up instead of having them tossed in a dish. They stuck to the slightly textured door of the safe very well, so whether it's because the keys are super light or there's a base metal alloy in my fridge paneling, I don't know.",5.0,2025-03-03,United State
Manifesta,"I have metal doors and purchased these to replace my coat rack.  The attached picture shows my TRX bag with the straps and is less than 2 lb. The magnet is advertised to hold 10 lb vertically and the magnet does not support the weight of this small bag.

The hooks easily support a set of keys, a hat, a scarf... however, you have to bundle at least 2 hooks together in order to support an empty handbag, and you have to band multiple magnets together to hold one jacket.

The diameter of the magnet is the issue I'm sure. The magnets themselves are pretty strong, but when you have an item that is larger that diameter is only going to support small objects because of gravity...and physics. Weight distribution is essential.

For example, a car has four wheels and a motorcycle has two wheels. When you are riding on a motorcycle the only amount of contact with the rubber to the road is about the size of a playing card and has less traction than a vehicle with more than 2 tires.

Magnets come disassembled from hooks.  I am sure this is for ease of packaging.

If you are purchasing these for strength, pass this product up.  However, if you want to utilize for vertical hanging object, like small light key rings, hats, scarves, plastic utensils on a string,  or other like items, this is a good purchase.

Joseph Canino,I like that the clasp or link opens and shuts.  It is strong and secure.  I used it to replace a clasp or link on an athletic bag.  The original fastener broke after 45 years.  The strap had a permanent loop and the only way I could re-attach it to the bag was with a link thst would fit through the loop on the strap and attach to the loop on the bag.,5.0,2024-09-30,United State

Noojin3,"I use them on my weight universal rack in weight and power lifting.  I liked that these fasteners were smaller (about 2"" in length) but held up to 800 pounds.  My other fasteners were 3"" and held up to 330 pounds, so these are better.  They are also stainless steel and resist rust versus my others that were steel / blued and over time, they did rust.  These also shortened the length the cable travels and provide about an inch more of stretch during the exercises, while adding 470 pounds of weight capacity.  Also, a very reasonable price for 5.

R1YWOIQNCIKUI4,"The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL HyperMagnetic is hands down one of the best gaming keyboards I've ever used! The build quality is outstanding, with a solid aluminum frame that feels premium and durable. Every keypress is smooth, responsive, and satisfying, whether I'm gaming or typing. The adjustable actuation is a game-changer, allowing me to customize key sensitivity to fit my playstyle perfectly.✅ Pros:  Premium Build Quality – The aluminum frame makes it feel solid and high-end. No flex or cheap plastic feel.  Smooth & Satisfying Typing – The magnetic switches feel buttery smooth and make both gaming and typing a joy.  Adjustable Actuation – Being able to tweak the sensitivity per key is an awesome feature, especially for fast-paced games.  Compact & Sleek – The TKL design saves space while still feeling comfortable to use.⚠️ A Small Warning:  SteelSeries Software Isn’t the Best – Compared to Razer Chroma, the SteelSeries GG software isn’t as intuitive. I found it more frustrating than helpful, so I just opted not to use it. Thankfully, the keyboard works amazingly right out of the box, even without software tweaks.🔥 Final Thoughts:If you're looking for a high-quality, ultra-responsive gaming keyboard with an amazing feel and top-tier build, this is 100% worth it. The software isn’t as user-friendly as Razer’s, but honestly, the keyboard is so good you don’t even need it. Highly recommend! 💯🔥",5.0,2025-02-11,United States 
R2SV71VFQK2PH7,"This keyboard has specific sensors for actuation, etc. so you can't really change the sound. The keyboard does sound fine as it is. Excellent quality on the screen and great lighting and colors. I wish you could upload the presets to the keyboard so it always did the same thing instead of needing to connect to the app on startup. Sometimes the keyboard will revert back to default and that sucks. This is a wired keyboard but that doesn't matter to me. Full size because I need the 10 key.",5.0,2024-12-10,United States 
RE5Y1Y0D2RL48,"I upgraded from my Logitech G915 to this. I am going to say, for me, this was a smart move. This keyboard offers so many functions compared to the G915. I am a gamer, and still am trying to figure out how to use the new things this ketboard has to offer for my gaming (outside of using it to cheat in fps games). I am inpressed with the lighting. My old keyboard had lighting as well, but it was weak. This is much more vibrate and has punch. As well, my old keyboard did not light up secondary key functions. This does. The keyboard lay out fits my hands. The G915 'low profile' just sucked. They didn't offer a wirst rest. This keyboard comes with one. As well I notice with this keyboard, I don't have as many typos like I use to. The keys are pronouced and easy to find without looking at the keyboard. I like the little LED screen in the conrer as well. I have seen people post about it saying it was worthless. Well I can tell you, you can make your own apps for it to your hearts dirsire. Issues: The Steel series program does have issues. Sometimes the lighting shuts off, then right back on. I have notice that the company is pushing out patches and updates. And the issue in not a deal breaker. While this does come with a very nice wrist rest, animal hair tends to stick to it. I have had to buy a lint remover and keep it down stairs with the keyboard. Everytime I pet my cats somehow their hairs sticks to the rest and is a pure pain to get off trying to to it by hand. All in all, it's a expensive keyboard, but this is a case of you ARE getting what you paid for.

This keyboard comes with nice stabilizers, dampening foams, and gaskets; which all aid in build and sound quality. As for the advantages in game I would not know as I haven't played valor ant or CS in a while so this review is strictly based on user experience of pure quality and typing enjoyment. The software is easy to navigate with many lighting options, and the included wrist wrest doesn't sit too tall or anything. The only thing I would say that's odd about the board is that the wrist wrest has a weird silicone feel and attracts dust, dead skin, and hair. Other than that I've had a great time typing on this board.",5.0,2025-01-26,United States 
R37FTMH2F89N14,"So far the keyboard has been everything I have wanted… almost. Great feel to typing, adjustable actuation(although NOT on all keys). The keycaps have a great feel to them and the lighting is excellent.However, the included wrist rest is IMO terrible. It is a rock hard piece of plastic with a matte finish. It is not comfortable at all. I came over from a full size Razer Huntsman V2 keyboard(wanted a TKL keyboard) that had a very nice PADDED wrist rest included and felt very good when typing. They NEED to do that here. I ended up ordering a RAZER TKL padded wrist rest and am using that in place of the included wrist rest.Second is the fact that not all keys are adjustable. Only the letters/numbers are. The outer keys like F keys, arrows and such are simply RED switches. This leads to an inconsistent feel between keys. IMO this is a CHEAP way of doing this and for this price, should NOT be the case. On Razer keyboards, every key is adjustable as they are all the same switches.Their software is ok. It does lack a few features in the lighting area that Razer has. One in particular is with Razer, you could set the angle of movement on things like color shift, so instead of being only horizontal/vertical, you could angle it to look like it’s coming from say the upper left to bottom right. Can’t do that here without doing a major individual key lighting set up. Overall the software is ok but could use additional features.The reason I chose this over the Razer was, I really like the sound/feel of typing much more than the Razer and I use this for work and play.ProsGreat feel to typingKey caps feel greatAdjustable actuation(on many keys, not all)Great lightingMehSoftware. It’s ok but need more lighting adjustments.ConsNot all keys are adjustable. This is a fail and a cheap way of doing it.TERRIBLE wrist restI love the typing on this so I am keeping it, but if SteelSeries reads this, STOP being cheap and make ALL keys adjustable. No reason at all to put red switches on the outer keys. Games these days, involve a lot more keys than just the letters/numbers and get a better wrist rest, padded!

R1FBPTM9QWSKUL,"The Steelseries Apex Pro is a superb keyboard. (Apology for the superlative!). It has been my favorite for the 10 days during which I tried seven other brands of keyboards.The typing was my easiest and best with this. I found out how much the keyboard wrist pad is useful.This, and other brands, I tried are for committed gamers. I have never played a single game, so you might wonder why I want it.This keyboard is more rugged, more resistant to passionate keyboard pounding during games. This can, and I believe, it does give it extra durability. Of course, durability and feature come with a price, but I have never regretted the keyboard design and manufacturing on that account.I do not want to paraphrase the features which are more than plenty in the ads. I like them all. The keyboard lighting is exceptional compared to others I have tested.My case has to do with guide and instruction the manufacturer publishes with the product. I must say the worst I had been exposed to was Logitech, even though I owned their products for several decades. In their case, it is a flimsy 2-page paper, where essential Logitech write-up shares its space with 9-10 other languages.My primary use of any keyboard is office type. My primary interest in the high-end gaming keyboards is the ability to create and use macros. Those macros can be used in non-gaming software, such as MS Office, Adobe, Movavi, and just about anything else.That was the place where my problem started. Inadequate documentation is common. Manufacturers count on the internet users to provide instructions for any aspect of the advertised features. If you cannot find what you are looking for you are ready for time consuming guesses.Actually, Steelseries Apex Pro is amongst the better ones. Unfortunately, there are those of us users, who had to be spoon fed the instructions despite decades of computer experience.I give Steelseries five stars, even though my initial bad guesses with the keyboard necessitated a return. But guess, the replacement is none other than Steelseries.",5.0,2024-10-17,United States 
R36ONBIBTBWMHV,"This keyboard isn't worth a third the price you pay for it. I'd have given this an extra star if I hadn't paid a premium for it; the cost in conjunction with how it just barely checks the boxes on its basic feature descriptions drops my rating to rock bottom.1. The keys are SO sensitive you'll be swearing that if you break wind in their general direction you're going to get five random keystrokes. It's ridiculous. You'd love to think that setting the key actuation point to the very bottom would let you work around this, but no; the actuation point goes nowhere near where the key bottoms out (other gripes on actuation settings below). Every single time you start typing at a comfortable pace you'll be bumping the sides of keys accidentally, and every time you get in a scramble in whatever game you're playing you're going to get extra inputs. From what I can tell, you can't replace the switches to something with a tactile feel or a heavier weight, even from the SteelSeries website (for other keyboards they sell: YES, the parts are there; for THIS model (Apex Pro): NO, there's nothing, at least as of the time of this review).2. In general, actuation settings have issues: a. You cannot apply actuation settings on anything to the right of the ENTER key or the Steel Series meta key itself or the Function keys. I don't know why I paid extra for a full keyboard over a third of the keys aren't fully functional. b. Dual actuation doesn't seem consistent or especially useful. I tried to find purposes for it but in my experience it's absolutely worthless. It also isn't available for the whole keyboard. c. It's also really easy to accidentally screw up all your custom actuation settings because by default it has all keys selected when you go into that part of the engine configuration, which is counter-intuitive because you might have come there while working on a specific key from the bindings or illumination tabs. For the same reasons, just don't EVER mess with actuation settings from the keyboard's built-in adjustments, especially if you have custom actuation settings on different keys, because you'll lose everything. d. The ""rapid trigger"" configuration fails to impress. Sometimes I think I can feel it working but I still miss fast double-taps frequently enough. This also doesn't work at all until after you apply a firmware update to the keyboard (at least as of when I bought this late in 2023) e. Setting a key's actuation value to 4.0 (represented as the bottom of the stroke visually in the settings) is still significantly high in the keypress.3. You can't cycle backward through on-board profiles, and cycling is slow and clunky. You also can't assign hotkeys for accessing specific profiles on the fly. This is especially annoying when you have custom keybindings, so moving from a game to respond to someone in chat is really slow and clunky.4. Macro keybindings don't work as you expect, unless they're brainlessly simple like Shift plus some other key. Not what I expected and not what I paid for.6. All the default illumination settings are childishly distracting novelties and completely unusable by anyone trying to focus on anything whatsoever. Be prepared for a trippy flashbang every time you cycle from profile #2 back to your profile #1 until you manually override all 5 illumination profiles on the keyboard.7. You must have 5 and exactly 5 profiles loaded at all times. You can't have less or more than that. You can store additional profiles in the engine config, but there's no officially supported way to back up or externally edit any of your profiles.8. You can't get to your Apex Pro engine configuration directly. You need to open this other app called ""SteelSeries GG"" first. The ""SteelSeries GG"" is also problematic because occasionally it will notify you that it needs an update but the notification vanishes extremely fast and you then need to find the update under Settings->About.9. The whole physical design of the keyboard: a. Why of all places would you put the keyboard's meta button for special functions and changing modes in the place of a commonly-used key? Why not put it in its own spot? Heck, why not put it in place of SCROLL LOCK which hasn't served any purpose whatsoever since 1985? Yes, you can re-assign it, but the key looks wrong and you have to do it for each profile. Just bad design. b. The keycaps themselves. Some edgelord at SteelSeries decided to be cool and invert the shift-modified character of each key with its unmodified counterpart, so for instance "":"" appears BELOW "";"" and ""?"" appears BELOW ""/"". This is just a visual thing and it won't bother too many people who already know how to type but it's just another wacky design choice that makes no sense. c. The cord for this keyboard is just COMICALLY stiff and thick. There's absolutely no justification for this, except maybe to keep it from getting stuck under your corner keys such as CTRL. If you occasionally have to rearrange your desk, such as for things like cleaning, or maybe swapping from your work setup to your free-time setup (this is my case) expect to have this cord fighting you every step of the way. d. Be prepared to have normal-width cords such as your mouse and headphones get stuck under the keys on the edge (looking at you, CTRL). There's nothing mechanically preventing this from happening. You'll regret this every time you find your CTRL key not actuating when you press it because you have a charging cable under it, or you drag your Apex Pro off your desk because your headphone cord was wrapped up in the top row of keys. Just make sure everything else on your desk is wireless and you'll be fine, I guess? e. The scroll wheel and special illuminated button on the top right of the keyboard. Seriously, I did NOT need another place to control my volume and play/pause videos. You CAN use this to adjust illumination and other settings but it's slow to start up and not especially friendly and it has potential to screw up your per-key custom settings. This behavior should have been customizable; in fact I dare say the scroll wheel should have been where you cycle up and down through profiles, and that button should have been the meta key.10. On a few occasions my profiles have become corrupt and/or de-synchronized from the engine config view while saving and editing. This is hard to reproduce but it sucks when you put a lot of work into sensitivity and custom bindings and illumination for a specific setup.Pros: It's a keyboard. Custom bindings work. It hasn't broken yet. Feels solid. For a full-sized keyboard it's space-efficient even though the cord is obnoxious.In conclusion, I think many of these problems could be alleviated by better firmware and engine config features, but not everything. The only special feature I really needed, the custom keybindings, is working, and I'm happy that the keyboard feels like it's unlikely to break anytime soon, but everything else is a disappointment. I should have returned this thing but it didn't feel right with the effort I put into setting it up and with my fingerprints all over it.Any remaining uncorrected typographical errors present in this review, I'm blaming the random stray keystrokes.UPDATE 2024-06-23:I WISH it was possible to give this product ZERO stars. It reset my actuation settings in today, at some random time after my tournament started. This isn't even the first time this happened but the timing couldn't have been worse. I tried to file a support ticket on the steelseries support site and while it said at some point I submitted a ticket successfully I've yet to get a confirmation email and I'm just endlessly going back and forth with their chatbot, which by the way is completely useless. If you intend to buy this keyboard for advanced use and competitive play I strongly advise against it, and if you do anyway, I actually feel sorry for you.",1.0,2024-04-07,United States 
RXEXOVY51MOV8,"UPDATE: I still really like this keyboard, but I was starting to notice that I actually type really inaccurately on it - it does get annoying. I just make a lot of mistakes, and I've been typing for 40 years and normally type about 100wpm. I was trying to figure out why this is, and lately I've had my old IBM Model M in the room hooked up to another computer and have felt the obvious difference in accuracy. (The Model M is where the modern keyboard layout comes from.) I still just type much better on the Model M. So I directly compared the two keyboards to figure out what the difference is.Obviously the Model M is bigger overall, but my big realization is that the actual key layout on the Model M is slightly wider. It's not just a difference in the ""dead space"" in between keyboard sections, either - there is actually slightly less space between each key on the Steelseries keyboard. I've compared all the keyboards I've owned against the Model M and while some have had minor layout variations and most these days have the function keys much closer to the main keys, this is the first time I've seen keys that were actually closer together. I'm sure it's not the only keyboard like that, but it's the only one I've owned that is and it explains my typing inaccuracy on it. I've taken a star off my original review for that reason. It is just not a full size keyboard, even though it looks like it is. It feels cramped, and I've never gotten fully adjusted to it.My original review is below:----------------------------------------For the price, it had better be good. And it is. My score is 5 stars but consider it more like 4 1/2 rounded up. A bit closer to 5 than 4; not perfect but nearly so. I'll explain.I'm both a typist and a gamer, but these days probably more of the former than the latter. Still, I try to find keyboards good for both purposes, and many are - heck, the old IBM Model M is still a great gaming keyboard if you don't need n-key rollover (and to be honest, most people really don't). But my old Motospeed keyboard, which I loved for its feel and its small footprint (as small as it gets for a full size keyboard) seemed to just wear out - it started repeating keypresses constantly, so I decided I'd just go for something new rather than try to fix it. (But I probably will fix it at some point; it's a great keyboard too.)This is the first linear keyboard I've owned in many years. I usually prefer clicky keyboards and have since the days of the original IBM PC and the Model F. But I just wanted something different after owning clicky keyboards for so long, and my Motospeed was *really* clicky to the point that it did become a little grating after a few years. I'd read about the wonders of the OmniPoint keyswitches in the Apex Pro and I watched the excellent Chyrosran22 review of it on YouTube (search for that; he knows keyboards and he loves this one). I did also manage to try one out for a brief few minutes, though not long enough to really form my own opinion. But in the absence of any more obvious choice, I took the plunge and bought one.Bottom line: It is a really well built keyboard (almost zero flex) that feels *almost* as good to type on as any linear keyboard I've ever used in about 40 years of computing. It has double-shot keycaps so the legends won't wear out, it's got a really useful volume roller, and it's got a little screen that can be used for various things, most of which are kinda dumb but I do use it for displaying current system stats - there is an app to display CPU, GPU and RAM usage. Its backlighting is pretty bright, fully RGB and has some effects that are actually kinda useful - I'm not sure what the effect I use is called, but it just lights the key you press up in white for a half-second or so before smoothly fading it back to whatever color the rest of the keyboard is backlit in. It's actually helpful to have a little split-second feedback showing which key you just typed, just in case you make a mistake.The OnmiPoint keyswitches do feel great - very smooth - and they're user-adjustable in terms of the actuation point. This is unique to this type of keyswitch, which is an uncommon magnetic sensor type of mechanical switch. I will say that I *feel* more accurate on this keyboard than my old Motospeed - I think the design and spacing of the keycaps on this keyboard is maybe a little more standard.So, that's that - now I'm going to tell you about the *little* things that keep it from being perfect. Keep in mind that absolutely none of these are dealbreakers, or things other people might even necessarily think of as drawbacks. But...The cord is non-detachable and it's quite stiff. It's also just rubber insulated, which is fine, but kinda ugly on such an expensive keyboard. The keyboard has two USB plugs, one for the USB port on the keyboard itself (it won't act as a hub, just a pass-through), and that USB plug is on the left side of the keyboard. That means if you want the keyboard cable on the right, which the cable management on the back of the keyboard lets you do, your mouse cable will still be on the left. I feel like this is an odd design given that most people are right-handed. A choice would be best, but if you're going to pick a place for one USB port, put it on the right.Only the ""main"" keys are OmniPoint - that's everything in the little ""typewriter"" cluster, that main rectangle of letters and numbers that you type the most on. The others are either Cherry MX Red or some kind of copy of them. To be honest, I'm not sure which switch I prefer! I know which I'm ""supposed"" to prefer but the regular Reds on the rest of the keyboard seem to have a very slightly lighter weighting. Probably my only semi-serious complaint about the keyboard in general - and this is 100% subjective, so it's not a top-line item for this review - is that the OmniPoint switches are just a *tiny* bit heavier than I like, and probably as a consequence of that feel very, very slightly ""mushy"" as you reach full travel. The switches on the rest of the board, while very slightly ""grittier"", are also a tiny bit lighter and do not feel mushy. All that said, I will allow that someone else could feel entirely the opposite. This is personal preference, and anyway it's not a big difference. But there *is* a difference in the switches on different parts of the board, and it does sometimes feel a little odd as a result.After only several *days* of use, the soft-touch finish is already wearing off several of the keys. Now, you can see by this review that I type a *lot*. So it may take longer for you, and anyway the legends themselves will never wear off since they're doubleshot. But my space bar is already looking a little ugly with one part of it already noticeably shiny. I never understand this - my Model F and Model M that are 30+ years old still look brand new, while a keyboard that's only days old (and cost a couple hundred bucks) already has a finish that's wearing off.Overall, though, I think I'll be happy with this keyboard until I get tired of linear keys and want to go back to clicky. But who knows when or if that'll happen. At the moment, I'm pleased with my purchase, even for the money. This thing does feel like an expensive keyboard.",4.0,2020-07-10,United States 
R1VGA7P2LVZ1QA,"I have owned a Razer Black widow Cherry Blue, Corsair k70 Cherry Red, Corsair k70 silver speed, Logitech G915 low profile red and Corsair K100 OPX. I must tell you that out of all the keyboards I have owned I like this one the best. The keyboard I am switching out from is the K100. I never really loved the k100, the first one I received had a loud pinging noise so I returned it for another and it was better but the sound and feel just wasn't something I fell in love with. The logitech G915 gave me finger fatigue due to the heavier actuation force required to push down on a key. The G915 Macro keys can also only save simple macros. Anything complex and it won't save, I confirmed this with their customer service when I thought I got a defect.Anyway, This Apex Pro Gen3 is amazing, it feels nice and sounds great. It doesn't have the Extra Macros keys but I don't really need them.There are two cons to this keyboard...1. No USB Passthrough in Gen 32.

R3CQSFJJUP1JOT,"Pros:Enhanced Energy Levels: One of the most noticeable effects of taking Shilajit extract was a significant boost in energy levels. I found myself feeling more alert and focused throughout the day, making it easier to tackle tasks both mentally and physically.Improved Stamina: Whether it was during workouts or everyday activities, I noticed an increase in stamina and endurance. This was particularly beneficial during intense exercise sessions, where I could push myself further without feeling fatigued too quickly.Enhanced Mental Clarity: Shilajit extract seemed to have a positive impact on my cognitive function. I experienced improved mental clarity and concentration, which helped me stay productive and focused on demanding tasks for longer periods.Overall Well-being: Over time, I noticed a general sense of well-being and vitality. I felt more balanced and resilient, both physically and mentally, which translated into a better overall quality of life.Convenient Packaging: Shilaget's packaging is convenient and user-friendly. The supplement comes in easy-to-swallow capsules, making it hassle-free to incorporate into daily routines.Cons:Taste: While the capsules eliminate the need to taste the Shilajit extract directly, the natural flavor can still be somewhat strong for some individuals. However, this is a minor inconvenience considering the benefits.Conclusion:Overall, my experience with ShilagetShilajit extract has been overwhelmingly positive. From increased energy levels to improved mental clarity and overall well-being, the benefits have been remarkable. While the taste may not be appealing to everyone, the convenient capsule form makes it easy to incorporate into daily supplementation routines. I would highly recommend Shilaget to anyone looking to boost their vitality and overall health.",5.0,2024-02-29,United Kingdom 
R1Y03Z659Q92OW,"When you taken regularly, I as a woman noticed I slept better and had more energy in the day. Lasts a long time and doesn’t taste terribly. There isn’t much of a smell either.

R1MEI1LRLSW0RC,"I’ve heard so much about Shilajit and the benefits it was supposed to bring, and all sounded too good to be true.The package arrived as expected and in the box is a glass jar of Shilajit and three wooden measuring sticks with markers on for 250 or 500mg doses.I took an initial loading dose of 500mg straight under the tongue for quicker absorption into the system, followed by 250mg in the morning at a night. I’ve now gotten used to the taste, takes a while but is bearable. I’ve only been taking it a week and blimey, I’m already seeing a difference in my daily performance at work, more energy and overall wellbeing.Now men, let’s get down to libido. So I’m 52, and over the last few years I’d basically come to terms that I’m not in my 20’s anymore and signing up to a monastery was becoming more attractive! Since taking this stuff, my application for the monastery has been put on hold! I’m not kidding, my testosterone levels have risen and girlfriend has noticed it too. In addition, my girlfriend who also has been taking it states that her sex drive has increased.I will certainly be sticking to taking this, 4-6 weeks on and 2 weeks off as recommended.

R1BWMHHS8EGCGU,"So I saw some vids on Shilajit and thought id give it a go. What started as a 3am tired ""must spend money"" exercise turned into something quite surprising.Shilajit is not a miracle cure for anything. Lets get that out the way.I didnt feel much (if anything) for a week of taking the guided amount every evening. However, after around 10 days I began to feel more energised in the afternoons (the ambiguous time between 3pm and 5pm) I havent changed anything else in my routine and work isnt any less demanding.I cant promise this isnt placebo, but i can promise there WAS an improvement.As for the product itself : Packaging is nicely designed and high quality. The product itself tastes ""ok"". Very ""earthy""...almost like muddy mushrooms (kinda). You soon get used to it. And actually tastes pretty good in Tea, like you have decided to try a new exotic Tea from some distant land you've never heard of!Results (if any) will be different for everyone. Its not enough to completely remove my scepticism, but i may just renew my order and keep going with this until its time to take a 2 week break as suggested. Why not.",3.0,2023-10-21,United Kingdom 
R2WPKJCT5K3LWO,"Shilajit has been a game-changer for me! I was initially skeptical about trying it, but after reading numerous positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot. And boy, am I glad I did!This product has truly exceeded my expectations. Not only do I feel more energized and focused throughout the day, but I've also noticed a significant improvement in my overall well-being. I feel more alert, motivated, and ready to tackle whatever the day throws at me.What I love most about Shilajit is its natural composition. As someone who prefers organic and ethically sourced products, I appreciate that Shilajit is harvested sustainably from the pristine mountains. Knowing that I'm consuming a pure and natural supplement gives me peace of mind.The customer service provided by the Shilajit team is also exceptional. They were prompt in addressing my queries and provided helpful guidance on how to incorporate Shilajit into my daily routine for maximum benefits.Overall, I highly recommend Shilajit to anyone looking to boost their energy levels, enhance their cognitive function, and promote overall wellness. It's become an essential part of my daily regimen, and I can't imagine my life without it now. Thank you, Shilajit, for this incredible product!",5.0,2024-05-09,United Kingdom 
R1XMXTXIME9ZJF,"Shilajit is like a hidden gem from the mountains, packed with all sorts of good stuff. It's a resin that's been used for ages in traditional medicine, and people swear by its benefits.One of the things that makes shilajit stand out is its rich mineral content. It's got iron, copper, zinc, and more. It's like a natural multivitamin, giving your body a boost of essential nutrients.But shilajit isn't just about the minerals. It's also got this thing called fulvic acid, which helps with nutrient absorption. So basically, it's like a superhero sidekick for your body, making sure all the good stuff gets where it needs to go.Now, I gotta be real with you. Shilajit has a unique taste and smell. Some people dig it, while others find it a bit earthy. It's like a flavor that takes some getting used to, but hey, it's all part of the shilajit experience.As for the benefits, people claim that shilajit can help with energy levels, focus, and overall well-being. It's like a natural energy booster that keeps you going throughout the day.But remember, my friend, everyone's body is different, so what works for one person might not work the same for another. It's always a good idea to check with a healthcare professional before adding any new supplements to your routine.Shilajit is like a little piece of nature's goodness, packed with minerals and fulvic acid.

The disassembly process for this laptop is awful as there is a risk of damaging the side ports if not spudged correctly. For those wondering the RAM is dual channel meaning there is a second slot making the laptops RAM upgradable. I highly recommend you purchase a higher capacity RAM for greater speeds as the laptop simply running one application tends to freeze or hinder the performance.I'm yet to test out the battery lifespan but I trust the 7H of uptime. The only downfall of this laptop is that the fans are at the base of the laptop, so if I'm studying at night with the laptop on my lap, the base tends to hear up and the fans go full blast.

The trackpad is really temperamental and not that responsive but after removing all the added 'zoom' and 'finger combinations' options it performed a little better. The overall laptop build quality is cheap, almost tacky cheap. It feels flimsy and fragile.After I removed all the bloatware and stripped windows 10 back to bare bones (turned of all the auto nonsense) it perfromed reasonably well. It is quick to boot, loads programs fast and doesn't get too hot. For Internet and office use it'll be fine for anyting more demanding look elsewhere.At it's current price avoid because you can get Asus i5's for the same cost and that'll leave this laptop standing.

R25YM07GIP35TU,These were a Christmas present for our 11year old daughter who has recently got into running. She loves them! After looking at some more expensive makes we decided to go for these as they had such good reviews and didn’t cost the earth! They are  great size - we were worried if they would be too big for her but they fit both her and the adults. They are lightweight and comfy to wear. So glad now that we didn’t go for these more expensive ones as these are perfect! They charge quickly and hold their charge-easy to use and great sound quality!

I’ve used them on beach, plane and for listening to podcasts whilst pottering around the house. Good range.My husband was so impressed with mine that I bought him a pair in black.Highly recommend.",5.0,2025-01-19,United Kingdom 
R33WQCNAKGP4ND,"I got these because my massive over-ear headphones had started to accumulate sweat at the gym and smell like a rotton pair of socks.These turned up in the post and looked as I expected, quite stylish and decent. They are simple to connect to a device and something nice is that once connected - as long as Bluetooth is on and device in range, these connect automatically when taken off charge.Time of battery in use, I would say I can give an honest answer to this because of my job - I have these on until they run out of charge. Genrally I would say it is about 7 hours constant use before the battery needs charging, a bad thing here is the constant reminder the battery is low, once it gets low they become unusable because they constantly say - battery low and this happens at about 50 or 40 percent.How they feel in the ear - use. These feel nice in the ear, however I have a issue with the left one slowly falling out of my left ear, I have to push it back in now and then, but this is probably just my ears shape. The sound is good, really nice and volume can be adjusted by touch control, its really nice and functional, works nice.Overall these are good and functional, for the price they are above average.8/10",4.0,2025-02-12,United Kingdom

R1SYRUSAHGYSD2,"I've only tried these a couple of times since purchase, however am very pleased with them so far. The build quality seems good and I like the 'hearing aid' design... I hate the feeling that wireless earbuds often give that they are about to fall out at any given second! The produst is comfortable in the ear and comes with 3 sizes of silicone 'plug' to allow for some custom fitting.The charging case seems to work exactly as intended and the charge is held well by both the earphones and the case (though I haven't had them long, so time will tell).The sound quality for audiobooks is excellent, a vast improvement on phone speakers. For music, I have found the quality a little more varied. With some tracks the audio sounds a little tinny, however in others it is very good. In my experimentation I have put this down to two key factors: the quality of the digital music you are listening to (which can be variable on several famous platforms) and also how securely and snugly the earphones are in the ear. The more snugly fitting, the better the sound quality.Overall - for the just shy of £20 price I paid - I am impressed enough to recommend!",5.0,2024-11-08,United Kingdom 
R2234FDMUS1LRM,"a) Product Overview:These wireless earbuds offer an exceptional audio experience, combining cutting-edge technology with sleek design.

Pairing was a breeze, and once I started my playlist, I was blown away by the audio quality. The sound is crisp, clear, and wonderfully balanced, with a bass response that truly surprised me given the price point.d) Pros:• Exceptional sound clarity across all frequencies• Impressive bass that adds depth to music without overpowering• Comfortable fit, even during long listening sessions• Great value for money, outperforming many higher-priced competitorse) Cons:• Touch controls may take some getting used to• Carrying case could be slightly more compactf) Comparison:Compared to other earbuds in this price range, these stand out for their superior sound quality and bass response. They easily compete with models costing twice as much, making them an incredible value.g) Recommendation:I wholeheartedly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for premium sound quality without breaking the bank. Whether you're an audiophile on a budget or simply want to upgrade your listening experience, these earbuds deliver beyond expectations. They're particularly well-suited for bass lovers who crave that extra punch in their music.",5.0,2024-11-19,United Kingdom

R2XM8840J9QLDX,"Pretty good so far. They look good and sound great (well, compared to other earphones in this price range of £20). Nice crisp audio with a good low end. Pairing was easy with my phone.  They are comfortable to wear.Some negatives:1. The touch sensitivity is temperamental. For example, single and double taps have functions as does holding down your finger for two seconds. But it doesn't always do what you want it to.2. There is inconsistency with the battery level readings - the case may say the earphones are fully charged (100% on one screen, full battery level on the other) but then it can read through on Android as 80 or 90% and that was after leaving them on charge. So this is definitely something I'll be keeping an eye on.3. Issues connecting with PC. This is not necessarily a fault of this unit but Davinci Resolve would not work properly with them. The sound quality dips considerably when opening that app (sounds like an old muffled tape). However other software is crystal clear. The only reason I mention it is because any reviews experiencing bad audio quality may have similar software issues and not realising it. Again, I don't think the fault actually lies with these units.4. One of the LED screen covers lifted off when peeling off the protective plastic which would suggest they didn't do a good job gluing it together.I've not tested making any calls yet so will update when I do. From what I've read when the battery is low (below 50%) you get a frequent beep. I really hope that's not the case.",4.0,2025-03-12,United Kingdom 
R2XIAF9MLM6Q2Q,I use these for the gym as my buds usually fall out at some point. The feel and fit is almost perfect for me. Snug but light with no feeling the hook bit at all. In fact they fit in my ear better than all there I have tried. Buds like Earfun free and 2 types of Anker.  So it's 5 stars for fit....at least in my ears.Sound quality is much better than I thought...as usual a bit bass heavy (as with all modern earbuds) but the overall sound is way better than anyone should expect from a cheap cheap pair. With a bit of EQ in the mid and top off the bass they are really good sounding and not just for the money.Best of all they are loud. I'm nearly 50 and have had years of headphones. These days most are too quiet. Maybe to stop people at 50 being deaf but I think it's a good thing. They do lose a bit of quality right at the top but hey these were £20! .... Best buds Ive had for a very long time. Charge was good and I bought the bright Orange ones which I'm glad I did because they are a nice bright orange not luminous. . Poonur though???

R1JLMST8IEHX50,"I recently had the pleasure of testing the latest wireless earbuds, and to say I'm impressed would be an understatement. These earbuds are nothing short of spectacular, offering an all-around premium experience that combines style, comfort, and top-tier performance.Sound Quality:The audio is rich, clear, and immersive. The bass hits with just the right amount of punch, while the mids and highs remain crisp and balanced. Whether you're listening to your favorite playlist, diving into a podcast, or enjoying a movie, the sound quality consistently delivers. The noise-canceling feature is especially remarkable, blocking out external sounds and allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your audio, even in noisy environments.Comfort & Fit:The earbuds come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a snug fit for every ear. They're lightweight and comfortable enough to wear for hours without any discomfort. I was surprised at how well they stayed in place during runs and workouts, offering a secure fit even with movement. The ergonomic design is sleek and minimalistic, so they look just as good as they feel.Battery Life:The battery life is fantastic. I was able to enjoy up to 8 hours of continuous listening on a single charge, and the charging case provides multiple additional charges. A quick 10-minute charge gives you an extra hour of playtime, which is a lifesaver when you're in a rush.Connectivity:Pairing these earbuds to my phone was quick and seamless, thanks to Bluetooth 5.2 technology. The connection was stable, with no dropouts, even when moving between rooms or areas with potential interference. The range is impressive, allowing me to walk around without having to keep my phone in my pocket.Additional Features:The touch controls are intuitive, allowing me to play/pause music, adjust volume, or take calls with a simple tap. Speaking of calls, the microphone quality is excellent, with clear voice transmission even in windy or noisy conditions. There’s also an impressive level of customization in the companion app, letting you tweak sound profiles to suit your personal taste.Durability:These earbuds are rated IPX7, which means they’re waterproof up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. Whether you’re caught in a rainstorm or sweating through an intense workout, these earbuds won’t let you down.Verdict:If you’re in the market for a pair of wireless earbuds that deliver on every front—sound, comfort, durability, and advanced features—these are the ones to beat. They’re a great investment for anyone who values both performance and style in their everyday tech. Truly an outstanding pair of earbuds that live up to all the hype.",5.0,2024-11-18,United Kingdom

RRQH1ABE5SHXM,"I have used these BT headphones for a couple of months now and overall they are ""ok"".The manual is well written, in multiple languages. English being the first.The accessories, cable and ear buds, are ok.The presentation box and packaging is very good.Plugging in the headset to a USB charger soon had them fully charged, nice presentation within the case to note their charge capacity and when full.The earbuds fitted ok and also paired to my phone without any issues. They also paired fine to a tablet, both devices being Android.They are comfortable in my ears, no adjustments really possible with this type of headset.I am not sure what they mean by ""4 ENC Noise Cancelling"", not what the technology means, but there seems to be no way to enable it according to the manual or with testing.  At this point I would suggest that it is not there. Typically I would manually enable such noise cancelling manually, not in this case.Various functions are assigned to the tapping of each earbud. Single tap on left lowers volume, on right increases.When these earbuds are pressed in tight, both the bass and volume are ok, personally I would not want it higher. But that is on full volume. If they are slightly loose the volume and bass is quite poor.Double tap is meant to pause the track, for me it just brings an Alexa or Google option up on my phone. Kinda pauses, but no means to return back to the music application to resume without using the phone.BUT if using the Android ""Music"" app the double tap function works. This could be app dependant, as well as to the device.When using for a Windows PC the pause double tap function works with media player classic.If you are repositioning these earbuds, as I need to do, to do with shape of ears, then it is easy to raise and lower the volume, that is just how it is.The battery life is claimed to be for 50H playtime. But on the rear of the box it states playtime is 10H for the headset. See photos.I would suggest that in the use I have had it is typical to need to charge them after a days use of ""average"" music / or audiobook listening. If used a lot, then expect less. More than a day very easily if just using for calls and not much in the way of extended calls......You get the idea, it is dependant on use.The battery charging is easy, just pop them back into the base, they dock. Then attach a charging lead. You do need to open the case each time tho to see if they are fully charged.The build quality has seemed good, nothing to complain about. The default rubber ear buds are easy enough to change, but are ok in size and fit for me.Bottom line......Decent ear buds IF bought cheaply. They are reviewed at their cheap and value price and for that they are decent / good. You will be disappointed if you expect the ENC noise cancelling to be functional. That just does not seem to happen.Happy enough with them, based on that price I noted. Decent sound overall, a little low on the total volume, bass and music clarity is ok to good, more so when fully pressed in the ear.If you are understanding the limitations of the headset, and the cheap price, then I do recommend these.Just set your expectations for what they are.Hope this has helped you.",4.0,2024-09-28,United Kingdom

R3LZFD9JX50GLA,"Sound: Good! Really crisp, clear sound. I've been hearing little elements of my music more clearly that my old wired buds did not really express. My only complaint is that the bass is a little thin, but given how tiny these guys are I can't complain about that too much.Bluetooth: Will say that every now and again the Bluetooth connection gets a little shaky even while my phone is just in my pocket and the sound skips a tiny bit, but it's not enough to detract from the listening experience too much. However, these stay connected and play okay almost all the way across the house! The automatic Bluetooth connection when you open the pod is really nice on the go, too.Battery life: Absurdly good. Granted I don't use them for hours a day, maybe an hour a day most, but I have had them for a month and I haven't had to charge them once. Incredible.Fit: Definitely small, but I have small ears so that suits me just fine. The buds themselves don't sit very deep in your ears so if you're looking for something that blocks out outside sound like earplugs, these aren't it. I would have liked if they blocked out outside sound a bit more.Controls: A little unintuitive and finicky, but that kind of comes with the territory of having touch based controls rather than buttons. I've tried to pause but either turned the volume way down or way up instead a good few times but I'm starting to get the hang of it.Looks and durability: Love the colour - I went for orange. Everything looks and feels really neat and slick and solidly constructed. I'm not a good judge on whether these will actually stand up to being carried around all day every day but I think they'll last well. My one complaint is that the brand name is a little unfortunate but I've covered it up with a sticker!Overall: Great earbuds for the price. I'd recommend them.",4.0,2024-09-20,United Kingdom

R1MGYT2ZX17MOK,"I love these little earbuds. They come in a cute little case that charges up really quickly and seems to last days. The earbuds also have excellent battery, I take them everywhere with me and find it very easy to connect to Bluetooth when I need it. Volume goes up high, the bass is good but not as strong as I usually like however you quickly get used to it.My issues are:1. I can only use the earbud controls to turn on and off, volume up or down - I'm unable to pause, skip back to the previous or forward to the next song :( fortunately, I'm chronically attached to my phone so it's not an issue to do it manually2. Sometimes the call quality is absolutely hopeless, at times it works really well but other times the mic picks up all sorts of background noise.Overall, it's a nice little product which I really enjoy using, could be improved but I'm happy with it for the relatively cheap price.",4.0,2024-11-27,United Kingdom

The base is almost non-existent and I do love my base however I use them for a 45 minute running 3 to 4 times a week, every time I put them back in the case it uses about 10% to recharge them.  So I would say that’s 10 uses before I need to recharge the unit. The sound quality is good for the price point, can’t comment on the IP rating yet because it hasn’t rained.

R3KSAWCL61F5ZO,"As a 75 year old I've always hesitated to try out any of today's modern technologies as I can easily get out of my comfy zone.Well, last year my grand daughter bought me an Electric Toothbrush. At first I was taken aback to think that this new innovation could be anywhere near as good as my manual brush. Well, I must admit that now I cannot do without it.The same applies to my old earphones. They were the wired up type, covered my ears & needed to be plugged into my Tablet to operate. After several years the wires had become very tangled up, the covers over my ears were loose & the sound quality had deteriorated, so you can imagine how frustrated I'd become.I realised that I needed to replace them with a new pair. I searched online for a similar pair but could only find the modern type ""Highly Sophisticated Wireless Little Ear Plugs"" that scared me as I didn't understand how this modern technology worked.Sheepishly I contacted my daughter for her advice & she assured me that these new modern ear plugs were easy to set up & the only way forward & that she would help me set them up.Well I cannot thank her enough for her excellent advice & I am so happy with my new ""Wireless Earbuds"", at their ease of use, quick re-charge, sound range, value for money & the good sound quality they produce that I cannot recommend them highly  enough.No doubt I am very happy with my new Earbuds & trust that you will find my experience a story to be repeated.",5.0,2024-10-18,United Kingdom

R15YW2UKJZYAY1,"Having lost a Lenovo wireless earphone bought from Temu, waking as a flight landed I purchased these as a replacement.I can't knock the first order discounted Temu/Lenovo version for £2, to be honest, they were great apart from the fact they kept falling out of my ears or I'd have to press them back in before they did, this meant inadvertently pausing the music or turning the volume up or down which was rather irritating.I've bought this pair to replace them with thingamajigs to wrap around your ear and hold them in.No more prodding them back in, they hold my ear as hard as I can shake my head without moving a millimeter or feeling like I'm going to concuss myself. They are noticeably louder at the maximum volume, on flights this will be fantastic, certainly too loud for normal use, loud enough to annoy an entire bus If I ever got on one and the sound quality is crystal clear.They hold 6 hours of playtime, with 50 held on the charging case against 3 hours of playtime, and 20 held on the case with the Temu, Lenovo version, and can be used for swimming for half an hour or just lolling in the pool without fear of damage.The sound quality is better but nothing that an occasional user would be bothered about, and they certainly feel well worth £19.99 from an allegedly reduced £89.99.If I'd paid the full price, would I feel disappointed? Not unless I saw them a week later at a lower cost.But are they worth ten times the Lenovo version?Probably not, as I will likely lose them at some point and could lose ten pairs at the discounted Lenovo price, at the full Lenovo price, absolutely they are worth it.Everything considered they are fantastic wireless headphones, shame about the brand name which makes me think of the morning after eating a terrible curry and drinking fifteen pints.🤦😆Anyway, I love them, I give them a solid 5/5 stars.",5.0,2024-07-28,United Kingdom

You don't normally get a decent built in mic with these type of ear buds, but I am told by people I speak to, that they are having to turn their call volume down slightly as the mic picks perfectly.I don't normally leave reviews, but these things are definitely worth the money.You won't be disappointed.",5.0,2024-09-11,United Kingdom

My last ear pods showed the battery % through the case. So can’t check if it’s finished charging without opening and looking.Controls while using the ear pods are a bit weird, can’t work them out.

Might be my ears. The sound is perfectly fine, especially for audio books or YouTube videos. Are they top end hi-fi? Of course not. But they are more than acceptable at this price. Regardless of what the description says they are not noise cancelling. At all. They are just normal in ear buds. Just be warned.All in, considering you could buy over a dozen sets of these for the price of Apple or similar buds, if you just need a basic set of cheap Bluetooth earphones I don’t think you would get a lot better.Overall…delighted.",5.0,2024-08-26,United Kingdom

I also recommended it to other friend and that's a ninth additional pair. I really like the idea that they can hook around your ears because I believe that the hooks make them more secure than the stems which are very common on the other earbuds. Personally, I saw these kind of headphones with someone else and it is because of the hooks that I fell in love with them. Also I like the deal that they came from £80 to £20. But honestly, if they were not on the deal I would buy them because they are perfect. Not only there is a quite a large number of colours to choose from but also they keep the charge very long. So far I charged them three times, however, I don't think that I would have to charge them when I did charge them because I charged them only to make sure that they would last me for the journey. I love the fact that I can sit in a taxi and be discreet with the headphones in one ear and use my phone and nobody would notice.

R1JNPYUUC3ONTO,"I was excited to try the hilajit Resin Gold Standard Shilajit, hoping for the promised benefits of this renowned Himalayan substance blended with Ayurvedic herbal extracts. However, my experience with this product has been less than satisfactory.Upon opening the container, I noticed a strong, unpleasant odor emanating from the resin, which was off-putting. Despite following the recommended dosage, I didn't experience any noticeable improvements in my energy levels or overall well-being after using this product for several weeks.Furthermore, the texture of the resin is quite gritty and difficult to dissolve, making it challenging to consume. The taste is also extremely bitter, making it hard to swallow without feeling nauseous.Overall, I'm disappointed with the hilajit Resin Gold Standard Shilajit. Not only did it fail to deliver on its promised benefits, but the unpleasant taste and texture make it a chore to incorporate into my daily routine.

R3DKSKX27DDJK3,"Having been investing in Alexa Dots for some years saw this newer version on a prime deal so added it to my collection . I normally replace an old version and find somewhere new to place the older one. My house is now pretty much covered with Alexa Dots now.As always with Alexa products this unit is easy to setup and install straight out of the box. As a veteran Alexa user I already have the app set up and used the Amazon preconfigured option selected at checkout ..If you are new to Alexa you will have to download and setup the Alexa app, which is also intuitive and easy to set up.Now to the Dot itself , it looks identical to the 4th generation dot so be a little careful when buying one and make sure you buy the generation you want . There should be better pricing and deals on the 4th Gen but the reason I purchased this one is due to some additional tech inside the unit and supposedly better sound quality.The sound is very good, not HI-FI quality but more than good enough for day to day use . ( I have paired 2 x Dots together in my main room to utilise the stereo options on the device. Apparently the 5th gen has a larger speaker/woofer and after comparing the 4th and the 5th gen together I can confirm the sound quailty is slightly better with particularly a better bass ) the difference in quality is NOT a huge jump from the gen 4 but still noticeably better , and is massively better than the 3rd gen Dot.An issue I have with both the 5th and 4th Gen Alexa Dot is the light bar is on the bottom of the unit. I use the light bar quite a lot to see if Alexa is responding in a noisy Enviroment or for notifications and as with most of my dots I buy 3rd party wall mounts for them to keep the cables nice and tidy and off a flat surface.the problem with this as most of these mounts place the light ring at the back and therefore close to the wall and makes the light bar hard to view. ( it’s a minor niggle not a deal breaker )The additional tech that grabbed my attention was the inclusion of a temperature and motion sensor.Both these would be ideal to add to my smart Home system to enable routines for heating and lighting etc so was eager to test these out.The temperature sensor:This is a great addition works very well and responds quickly to voice commands. I tested the accuracy by putting another smart temp sensor in the same room with an additional stand alone temperature sensor.The accuracy of the Alexa sensor was accurate and comparable to the two other sensors tested in the same room .. it is so easy to add it to routines in the Alexa app and works well.The Motion Sensor:I was eager to try this out as well as I wanted to make use of it Alexa routines such as if someone walked in the room the lights switched on and if there was no motion for a set time the lights would switch off. This is a fairly simple routine in the smart home .Unfortunately the motion sensor in the Alexa Dot 5th gen is pretty much useless and simply doesn’t work. It uses a slightly different way by detecting motion using ultrasonic technology. I realise this technology wouldn’t be the best as any noise in the room, such as TV , people speaking etc would diminish the accuracy of the sensor .. however having tested it many times in a completely silent room it simply doesn’t work , and on the odd occasion it does actually work it’s usually from an unknown source and not actually from someone entering the room.Conclusion: if you want good Alexa integration , a more than adequate sound for every day use , and a temp sensor buy this with no qualms that you will be getting a good quality product that works well straight from the box.If you are buying this for the motion sensor tech , don’t bother it’s useless and you would be much better off buying a separate smart motion sensor . The Echo Dot version is unreliable and just going to give you many headaches",5.0,2023-12-08,United Kingdom 
R10E5C6Y32OZBP,"These devices, are brilliant. They sound good and are well built. The clock display can be brightness adjusted. They are, easy to use, easy to set up and suitable for people who might by age or inclination not be remotely considered geeks or tech enbracers. Kinda great to have one and have elderly or hearing impaired relatives, in my case my 101 year old and hard of hearing mother) have one and just be able to say 'Alexa call - - - - "", and make a call as simply as that... And for free!I also use mine as an Internet radio and with Amazon Music the sound is, really very good, I just have to say play - - - - and  it's like owning pretty much every album and single I can think of.Only things that I'd like improved is that when fact finding on some political  subjects it clearly is set to try and spot 'politics' and will either not respond or just say it cannot help, but I understand why Amazon decided that.The speech recognition technology is extraordinary and recognizes what I say  perfectly when full of cold, even Covid, heck even when I am barely awake and talking with my face planted in my pillow!The only real flawObviously, it requires broadband.",5.0,2024-12-15,United Kingdom

R2VN2WVKWA2OM4,"Two years have passed since I reviewed the Amazon Echo Dot Gen 4 and now we have the new Echo Dot Gen 5 so it’s time to revisit the world of Alexa.If you’re familiar with Echo and Alexa, you’ll only be interested in the first part of this review and you can ignore everything after my device appraisal. I’m sure, though, that many people may be new to smart speakers so I’ve also added sections on how to install the Alexa app, how to set up your new speaker and what you can subsequently do with the Echo Dot. My apologies for going over things that you might already know and a lot of this repeats from my previous review, but there will be for which this is new territory.The Device:The Echo speakers have been around for many years now, and despite the best efforts of Google and Apple, Amazon’s Alexa still remains the smart assistant of choice. The most popular of all smart speakers is the Echo Dot. Other bigger and better sounding speakers are available including Amazon’s own larger Echo, but the Echo Dot has always hit a nice sweet spot of performance and affordability. The first couple of generations of Echo Dots were clearly toes in the water to see if we were ready for smart assistants. They gave us a glimpse of what could be achievable, but they didn’t sound particularly good. We’ve still got a couple of Generation 2 Echo Dots that live in the garage and shed, and they really do sound tinny and weak. That changed with the Generation 3 Echo Dot, of which we have seven around the house, as they sounded so much better. The sound was deeper and the volume could go much higher before losing fidelity. The microphone was also improved, and the entire experience with using Alexa made a big step forward.Two years ago I bought an Echo Dot Generation 4 on release day, and shortly afterwards followed that up with the larger Echo. And today, the Generation 5 arrived. I’ve spent several hours since then playing with it, testing it out alongside my existing speakers and the very similar Generation 4.So, what’s different between the Gen 4 and 5? Well, visually, not very much. The only real difference I could spot was the loss of an auxiliary port from the rear of the new device. Beyond that, no difference at all. I read from the press releases that the 5 is sonically much improved over the 4, but in side-by-side testing I struggled to see much difference between the two. If anything, I felt that Alexa’s voice when she’s talking to you seems like she’s stood a little further away. But it still sounds great. Not just great for the money, but great in general.We have much bigger and better speakers in our house, but when listening to music we almost always play it through the Echo Dots. I’ve got a Bose speaker right next to the Dot in my office, but always use the Dot for music. I work from home and I’m in my office 9-16 hours per day, and the Echo Dot is on for most of that time. If you want the absolute best sound, you’re likely to want to spend much more on a dedicated sound system, but for general, everyday use, the Echo Dot is brilliant. Sound remained stable even at maximum volume, and just as good I found Alexa was able to hear my commands despite cranking the volume up.Something new to the Generation 5 is the introduction of “tap to pause”. A quick tap on the dome of the Echo will pause your music. A simple addition, but so welcome. When someone rings me when I’m working a quick tap is so much better than yelling at Alexa to shut up before I can accept the call. Another tap will resume the music.I have to say, even two years down the line, I still prefer the shape of the Echo Dot Gen 3. I just preferred the puck-shape, and it sat lower to the ground so didn’t obstruct the view of the monitors on my desk. The buttons for volume, action and turning off the microphone are on top of the globe are raised characters resembling a games controller. The status light is around the base of the speaker rather than the top on Gen 3 and earlier devices.Setting up the Echo is, as usual, very simple. If you have a previous Alexa system them it connects straight to your existing network with no input at all. If it’s your first Echo device and assuming you have the Alexa app you go to Devices, Add, Amazon Echo, and wait for it to connect. The work of moments, and then it’s ready to go. Like the Gen 3 and 4 it uses its own power cable rather than a USB cable as the Gen 1 & 2 used.So, the verdict? The RRP, and reviewed price, is £54.99 which is £5 more than the outgoing Gen 4. The tap to pause feature almost makes up that £5 for me. I read in early press releases that the new Gen 5 can also be used as a Wi-fi repeater in compatible mesh systems such as the Eero range, but I didn’t see anything further mention that in the Amazon sales page and I’ve not been able to test that out. Just like the Gen 4 before it, the Gen 5 will almost certainly become the biggest selling smart speaker on the market. I’ve been more than happy with it in my early time with it and find it to be a great albeit minor evolution of the previous Dot.Once again though, the only real competition to Echo Dot is its own predecessors. The Gen 3 Echo Dot is still available at the time of writing. It’s almost as good to listen to, and I think looks nicer. It’s also quite a bit cheaper. Is the Gen 5 that much better than the Gen 3 to warrant the price premium? I’m not so sure, but I do like to keep up with the latest releases where possible.Taken in isolation, the Gen 5 Amazon Echo Dot is an excellent smart speaker. I gave the Gen 3 and Gen 4 a five-star review, and the Gen 5 gets the same accolade. It will undoubtedly go on to be the best-selling product of its type.How to set it up you Echo device:If you’re new to the world of Alexa then you may be wondering how easy it is to set up an Echo device. If you’ve ordered from Amazon, they’ll helpfully email you a guide to setting it up. You’ll need the Amazon Alexa app, available from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Download and wait for it to install, and then open it up. The app gives help on various subjects if you tap the question mark in the top right corner of the home screen. The guide on setting up your new Echo Dot is found in this area by selecting Alexa Devices, then Echo Dot, and Set Up Your Echo Dot.As a quick overview though, plug in your Echo Dot (after a short period the status light will turn orange to show it is in Setup mode) and then open the Alexa app. On the bottom menus select “Devices”. On the Devices screen, tap the “+” button in the top right and choose “Add Device”. Select “Amazon Echo” and then “Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and more”. Assuming your Echo is plugged in and the status light is orange, select “Yes”. The app will then search for your new Echo Dot and complete the setup. The whole process takes only a few moments, and then you’re ready to get creative with Skills and Routines.What you can do with Alexa:A smart speaker is actually quite dumb to start with. It’s when you start adding things that it becomes truly smart in my view. On its own, you’ll be able to ask Alexa questions, play a few games, set up alarms and reminders and get a weather forecast; the general things you’d expect from a home assistant. Remember to always begin every command with the wake word, “Alexa…”, which can be altered to “Amazon”, “Echo” or “Computer” if you wish. To do certain things and play games you need to enable “Skills & Games”, which is found in the “More” menu at the bottom of the app. In there, you’ll find hundreds of things you can do with Alexa. For example, I regularly play the BBC quiz shows Pointless and Tenable. “Alexa, what is the weather forecast” or “Alexa, give me a ten-minute countdown” are examples of simple commands.As I say though, the Echo is just the gateway to a vast array of smart applications. How smart it goes depends on how far you want to go and how much to spend. What starts out as a single Echo device can quickly expand to a device in every room, attached to smart devices such as light bulbs, sockets, central heating and cameras. The first thing you may wish to use your speaker for is playing music. Echo is compatible with most of the main music streaming services such as Apple and Spotify, and of course Amazon Music. With your Echo you get access to Amazon Music’s free service, which is actually pretty good. It is limited, and you won’t find all of your favourite artists, but I recommend you try it out for a week or two as it might be good enough for your requirements. If not, I do highly recommend upgrading to Amazon Music Unlimited, or better still Amazon Music Unlimited Family which can be shared with multiple family members (not necessarily in the same household). I’ve not encountered many songs that aren’t on there. I used to have my iPhone full of mp3 music, but now I stream everything. “Alexa, play some 80’s rock” and I’m good for hours. If you have multiple speakers you can have the music played to one, many or all of them for house-wide coverage.Philips Hue lightbulbs are fantastic devices. They’re very expensive compared to a standard LED bulb, but once you buy one and use it in conjunction with Alexa voice control you soon become hooked. We’re up to 30 Hue bulbs now, and I don’t regret a single purchase.Smart sockets, such as Amazon’s own models or the TP-Link Kasa models, that I recommend, are great for controlling things like Christmas lights and lamps.Your central heating can be controlled by Alexa if you have a suitable smart thermostat. I can ask “Alexa, what’s the temperature in the house?”, and having determined that it’s too cold, if my wife not wrapped head to toe in fleece blankets wasn’t enough, I can then say “Alexa, set the house to 20 degrees”.Some door bells and cameras, such as Ring products, work with Alexa voice control also. “Alexa, show me the front door” and she’ll bring up live video on a suitable device like a Fire tablet or an Echo Show.Many televisions also have Alexa integration too. Our LG OLED can be controlled by its built in Alexa.A comprehensive smart home/automation is expensive, I’m not going to sugar that pill, but if it’s something that interests you then look out for these extra products on Black Friday deals would be my tip. All the devices I’ve mentioned and shown on my reviews were purchased from Amazon.I’ll leave it there though as I’ve waffled long enough. I hope you consider giving the Echo Dot a try. I’m of the opinion that the worth of a gadget is in how much you use it, and we use our Echoes and Alexa frequently every day.",5.0,2022-10-29,United Kingdom 
RJ04GI8RRL9H3,"I generally like the Echo Dot devices, we have one that can play music in our gym and pre-heat the gym as well (using smart plugs and a heater, obviously). They all control lighting and plugs, although not everywhere in the house, and they can get readings from each other provided I write the correct command language scripts (not difficult), such as getting the temperatures in the four rooms that have Dots in them.We're not dependent upon them, but they are often useful, especially when our hands are full and we need to switch on a light, or we need to light a terrarium for our tortoise for the number of hours they need of heat and UV - ""Alexa, turn on Bert for four hours"". It's all handy stuff, if somewhat lightweight tasks. It's nice to be able to do these things from elsewhere in the house as well, saves a lot of running around.Lying in the bath and wishing you'd put some music on? Just ask! Lying in bed and realising you'd left the hall light on after the guests left? Likewise!As discovered recently, however, an internet outage will create any number of problems because as far as I can tell, Alexa and the Dots (a band name if ever there was one) don't have an ""autonomy mode"" where they can still run things around the house when the internet isn't there. They even reverted to ""speaking American"" to me to tell me that the internet was unavailable. Yeah, fine, but I just wanted you to turn on the living room light!I imagine these go to the internet for a history of our voice commands or something along those lines, when it would be better to have a fallback mode in them for when that technological lifeline isn't available.Like all tech things. When they're working well, things can be delightful. When they're not, it can be the equal and opposite nightmare.To me great relief, the old Alexa personaity came back along with the internet.As far as the actual device goes, the sound from them is decent and moderately loud, and they're reasonably controllable. They can measure temperature within 15-30 minutes of having been switched on. They are able to detect if someone is in the room (presumably because they are ""listening"" and can activate lights based on someone coming in). They can also run routines based on sunrise and sunset times (although we need to be able to program these) and this allows us to provide the illusion of intelligence to the way the Dots operate. We have a routine to switch on lights when we enter the gym, but we use other time-based routines to switch this ""lights on and off"" routine off during daylight hours so that the lights don't go on in the middle of the day. So the lights routine is switched on and off by a second routine that is looking at the sunrise and sunset times for our location, and deactivating the lights routine 15 minutes before sunrise and reactivating it 15 minutes after sunset. So, their abilities are somewhat extensible.The feature we most use is actually the reminders and alerts, and in some cases we can dictate a message to the Dot and have Alexa issue a verbal reminder of whatever it is I'm supposed to do, in my own voice.Maybe our most useful feature is implemented with the Meross smart plugs that we use. These seem to be great value and can measure the power drawn through them as well, which is interesting if you really want to see what that fan heater is costing you. This is how we light up our tortoise, this is how we flip a switch on that plug socket that is actually hidden behind a bookcase and otherwise impossible to use, and this is how we turn on our Xmas lights outside 15 minutes after sunset and turn them back off at 9pm. They are all lightweight ""problems"" that might be too much of a faff if we had to do them manually, and the Dot is central to these small things.This might sound like I've gone mad for automation - I've not. These are simple things that are easy to implement, and I have had a foretaste of what would happen if we went too far - we'd end up adapting our own behaviour to fit the automation, because we're the most flexible device in our house.So while Amazon's advertising might tell us all how much fun it would be to star in our own sci-fi movie every day in bright-shiny-land, the truth is that when something mundane like an internet outage occurs, we can quickly get back to that other sci-fi moment we all ought to remember.""Alexa - Open the Pod Bay doors"".And yes, you will get an answer to that.",3.0,2024-09-16,United Kingdom 
R17Y0Z2619SH33,"I got the echo dot on sale for around £25, and I think it represents good value for money at this price point - I think I would've been left slightly disappointed if I'd paid RRP. The sound quality is good for the size of the device, yet is still lacklustre when compared to a dedicated speaker of a similar/slightly larger size. I will happily listen to music up-to around 50% volume, but any higher and the sound becomes pretty distorted and tinny. Voice recognition works very well, however, and I mainly use my Echo Dot to control the other smart devices within my home. I also often use it for alarms, timers, and questions that I have throughout the day. It's very responsive, and recognises questions and commands very quickly. I would strongly suggest purchasing this as a command hub for a smart home, which is where it shines best.",4.0,2025-03-16,United Kingdom

For some time now it is impossible to get into the management of the echo dots that I have (3). There is a report of being unable to load the page which just repeats itself constantly. This is reported by others on the web going back to 2023 and, as yet, Amazon has not offered any meaningful fix for this (I have read many of the forums and most of the advice is irrelevant). It is not firewalls of rebooting or reinstalling the app as I have done all those things more than once. So be warned this can happen to you after some time. Otherwise an excellent product.",4.0,2025-02-19,United Kingdom 
R29JRZCFZ7NRQG,"I bought this, in all fairness, because I wanted a cheap little speaker for the kitchen.Tye sound quality is ok, nothing special, the bass is lacking, and cannot find a graphic equaliser anywhere in the settings.The logic behind what is displayed as standard in the app and what you have to go searching for, and then end up googling where it is, baffles me.During the setup it asks you to select your preferred music streaming service, obviously Amazon prime music is the default, but in that section you can also set up pod adts and radio stations you prefer, ... however.... It only lets you select one, before the setup kicks you onto the next topic, and when you go back in, after setup is completed, you cannot find podcasts, radio or even music anywhere in the many icons, so I googled, and it is hidden behind 3 layers of other, unrelated options.Why??It will s first and foremost a speaker and yet anything you want to listen to is hidden away in the bowels of unrelated options??However, once set up, favourite providers selected, all you have to do is say ""Alexa...play my "" insert name of music provider""  + "" insert name of playlist"" and it does.You can say Alexa pause music, Alex continue playing, in fact I am not sure that one is an official command, it is simply what I said, when whilst finalising where exactly in the kitchen thedpeaker would sound best and not be in the way, I accidentally pushed something that made the music stop, so in a panic I thought oops I have messed up some important setting, so blurted out Alexa, please continue playing music, and it did, so I have stuck with that command .If you are young or have other Alexa things, this might all be second nature, but as my home set up was set up by my son, and is mainly Google, I was actually really pleased I managed to get so far, all on my own.Things you need to know: 1: your broadband/ network password, it needs it to set up.2: your music service, podcast service, radio service passwords, it asks for these during setup, something my Google system didn't as far as I remember.3: it is a plug in speaker, however, Amazon sell seperately a base for it that is rechargeable, I think it is designed so that you take the speaker and the base with you outside. Personally I am waiting for that to be on sale as currently the base aline costs £20 more than the 5th gen speaker.Problems...It has the option of adding items to a shopping list.I thought I would try it out on getting the Alexa 5th gen speaker to shop on Amazon, made sense to me, first so that the minimum amount of issues should arise....I learnt the command "" Alexa buy "" whatever"" on amazon.co UK, and it came back with the item i had previously bought, which is what I actually wanted, it told me the price and Said it had popped it in my Amazon shopping basket, it then said if I wanted to buy it now I should say "" buy it now"", which I did, and then it made it's little action beep sound and i pootled along. I then did it again for another item.Later that day, I happened to be checking the delivery time for something I had bought on Amazon on my computer, and I noticed the basket showed I had two items in it.I checked the basket and it was the two items that i had asked Alexa to"" buy it now"".I checked my order history and , nope, Alexa had not bought it now, it had just popped them into the basket.If I hadn't logged in to check a previous order, I wouldn't have received the items that I had asked Alexa to "" buy it now"".So, perhaps teething issues or mayhap I should have said "" Alexa... buy it now"" but each time it made that little beep sound it makes when it carries out a command so I thought I had achieved my goal, that the Alexa had understood and carried out the command, so that is why I mention it here, in case anyone else has the same issues.I have some smart home devices that, at the time of setting up this little speaker, I didn't want to get into, so skipped that bit of the setup, however....I recently added two new devices , a smart lightbulb and another item from the same company.During these set ups of these devices using that manufacturers app, it asked to link to my Google and my Alexa, and it went well.The second setup was even quicker as that manufacturers app just linked all by itself after the first item, and Alexa spoke and said it had linked with this new smart home device from a completely different company, however..It did this, when I had turned the mic off / privacy mode on ( there is a privacy button on the top of the speaker, well there are 4 buttons, all odd shapes, certainly not industry standard logos accepted for things like on/ off or up/ down.)This is touted in the 5 th gen as the privacy button, which ensures you privacy and makes the light at the bottom of the speaker turn red, however as I mentioned, it linked and spoke to me whilst in this privacy mode.Also, the red light changes colour all by itself if I am having a conversation with someone in the kitchen, it goes yellow, blue and back to red whilst we talk, and then settles to red again if we stop, my friend noticed it so we played a game to see if indeed it was us speaking that made the colours change, and it was, which it shouldn't, because Amazon state that with the privacy button pressed, and the speaker light is red, the microphone should be completely off, so... How did the speaker hear we were talking to change colour when we talked and go red every time we stopped???I really only caved into buying an Alexa when they adversed the privacy features, as I really don't want anyone or anything listening in on my conversations.Google use a secrecy, local processing ( i.e. what you say never leaves your device to be processed/ listened to elsewhere, it gets privately processed on your device only.Amazon Alexa doesn't.All requests go via the web, through their cloud farms, and may or may not go to various government bodies, listened to by actual people.I don't like this.So I popped it in a cupboard.It only comes out and switched on when I want it on.It is vaguely possible that there is something wrong with mine, however if you do buy one, try the "" secret whispers "" game my friend and I played...1. Press tye privacy button to on, wait for the speaker to go red.2. Wait 5 minutes just to be sure.3. Start talking and watch the lights change.4. Stop talking and watch it go back to red.Repeat 3 & 4 , getting quieter and quieter until you are just whispering.If you get the same result, i.e. the speaker colour changes in privacy mode, when you talk .. I can highly recommend the cupboard technique.Hope some of this waffle is useful to someone.",4.0,2022-12-15,United Kingdom 
R19YJDD9Q2Q6SF,Possibly one of the most amazing media products (In my opinion) ever produced! Breath taking technology which works faultlessly amazing software back up and operating system at an equally amazing price I have 4! However my latest Gen 5 (Jan 25) no longer features the discreet LED clock. when I purchased the AMZ photo showed the clock which has now been changed reducing the wonderful 'DOT' to an amorphous 'blob' Clearly to reduce costs there was no reason to remove the clock as the software allows you to dim it to nothing. The fantastic Amazon have ruined their unique product to keep a price point I would have been happy to pay a little extra. You can purchase another model with a clock but these do not have the same simplicity of design.

R3808RSD3DWI0W,"I sort of like the Alexa but there's still a lot of work to do.Good:- Can hear you easily and clearly for the most part, and comprehends simple commands with a decent degree of accuracy. Fairly fast responses- Good at simple tasks, e.g. ""Turn the light on, set timer for 15 minutes, cancel my current timer, take two minutes off my timer, add five minutes to my timer, snooze alarm for 15 minutes, remind me to clean the oven at 5pm, tell me the time, tell me how much time is left on my timer, add cheese to shopping list, remove cheese from shopping list.""- It will tell you if you try to add a duplicate item to any list- It can buy things for you from Amazon without you needing to look at them, as long as you're happy to buy whatever the Amazon recommendation is for the product you specified- It can answer some basic questions perfectly well, especially mathematical problems, the kind people struggle with (e.g. ""what's 12 per cent of 40"" ""what day will it be on 4 March, 2024"".- A great way to set recurring reminders without having to pick a phone up and type them, or check your phone for them- A great way to wake up in the morning, with music from Amazon music, or a radio station etc, at a set time- A great way to access radio stations without fiddling with a dial- A great way to shuffle music you like within a theme from Amazon music (free version). Specific songs if you have premium- A great device for playing relaxing sounds, like rain, for about two hours to help you sleep- Great hands free task setting, letting you keep going with whatever you are doing- Good hearing, can usually hear you from across the room (in a fairly quiet room) if you speak up- Good voice recognition - you can make commands while watching TV without it getting confused as you what you are saying and what is background chatter- Good with location based weather and temperature updates, as well as traffic updates on specific roads. It can also tell you about current train strikes. Once you set your location you can ask 'what's the weather like here' and get a forecast for your area etc- Can give you a news briefing on command from one of a few sources, including BBC and Sky- Can connect to your smart devices and plugs, and turn them on and off hands freeBad:- Very bad at answering nuanced questions. Alexa has given me quite the wrong answer several times. It takes it answers from a questionable search engine (Bing?) and Amazon/Alexa answers, which is just not good. For example, I asked it if I could put my wooden plate in the microwave; Alexa said yes, and ruined the plate. Google is much better for those kinds of questions.- Struggles with long or compound sentences even when they are important or common, such as ""set an alarm for every Thursday at 10am"".- Very bad at deleting future reminders and alarms. Commands such as 'cancel my Thursday alarm' often don't work. It also does not recognise the simple construction 'cancel my next alarm', requiring you to be specific, which can take ages or may require you to remember specifics you don't recall precisely. It may also then list all your alarms, which is a classic example of Alexa rattling on at length uselessly, forcing you to cut it off (Alexa, stop!) and give up on the command (you can do it via the Alexa app instead). It is similarly bad with notifications, for the same reason- Cannot understand some common and normal commands, such as ""set a reminder to pay rent at 10am on the last day of every month"" - it does not understand the concept of 'the last day of the month'.- Babbles on with excessive and irrelevant detail when asked some questions- Struggles to recognise the difference between a command and a question, e.g. 'can you cook chicken from frozen' may sometimes cause Alexa to tell you she doesn't know how to do that, or that she isn't connected to an appropriate appliance- Often gives you entirely different answers when you rephrase the question very slightly. Often requires you to repeat the same request in several ways to get a proper answer. The top answer is mysteriously chosen - again, Google is better at picking the best answer to a question- Has an unfortunate tendency to stop playing music if you tap it or knock it, regardless of whether you want this- Cannot answer questions about its own status, such as 'what are you doing, why have you stopped' or an accurate answer to 'are you ok' (it says yes even when there's clearly something wrong).- Sometimes struggles to recognise certain words, and the names of lists - will sometimes ends up adding new lists or bizarrely adding the name of your list to your shopping list, as if it's a product- Is not great with regional accents, even my factory standard southern RP - mistook the term 'space heater' for 'space eater' and gave me a very odd definition indeed!- Speaks when unwanted, just to apologise and give a boring explanation for stopping playing music ('Sorry, Amazon stopped playing music because there was no activity on your device'). Repeats this every time- Stops playing music randomly, or stops due to inactivity even though 'inactivity' is to be expected when you're using your Alexa as a radio while busy doing something else- Often does not react to the instruction to 'resume' (music) on the first try and requires you to shout at it- Cannot do compound commands, such as ""turn on the light and the dehumidifier"". These instructions must be made one by one, which can be time consuming- Totally ballsed up playback of a well established podcast, jumping back to an earlier point for no reason (with no ability to restore). I think Amazon music is likely to blame here, I have found it questionable on other devices, too- Often the volume is much louder than you expect and commands to turn it down frequently fall on deaf ears. It does not appear to be a very consistent volume.",3.0,2023-03-14,United Kingdom

RKV1SRZCJZCW3,"For a mature product this seems occasionally badly thought out, with bugs/issues.Set-up was easy - just set the Wifi addresses. I couldn't however set the device name in the app to ""Kitchen"" - the name just wouldn't ""stick"". Doing this on a PC on my Amazon account and it let me know that there was already a device called ""Kitchen"" (there isn't) so wouldn't set another one the same. I renamed it ""Kitchen1"" and it's set.I was working quickly, giving it my smart-plugs to control, and signing into BBC Sounds.My wife, who's Amazon account is linked to mine was not so easy. Implicitly linked to the Echo dots, but they don't appear as devices for her (to manage) but things like announcements DO work, but you wouldn't know how.You can also ""alexa, switch profile"" to get HER logins for the various other services (e.g. BBC Sounds). None of this very clear in the app. They're not personal devices - shared as they are in the household.I don't think it's possible to set the children up on the app to work with the echo-dots. No announcements or shared calendars that way then.Alexa only really understands a few things. Don't expect an answer all freeform questions. Also don't ask ""her"" to sing.A big concern is WHAT THE HECK ARE AMAZON DOING HANGING ONTO ALL THE RECORDINGS FOR AT LEAST THREE MONTHS. You type stuff on a computer, it doesn't remember every keystroke for months on end. Whilst it may be processed ""in the cloud"" it doesn't need to stay there for an extend period.They are of course very keen that you buy stuff - and would have happily signed me up to Amazon Music for £5.99/month when I searched for a particular tune. I turned off voice purchasing though.So a dark undertone that these devices are not for my benefit but for the Amazon Great Corporate Machine, but they're a bit of fun (novelty hasn't worn off yet) rather than a serious tool.We got them so us parents can make remote announcements to the household to replace the ability we had with our old answerphone (now we haven't got a land-line).Otherwise, they're small, smart and sound pretty good. Time will tell if they're genuinely useful or if someone manages to accidentally spend money so they end up in the bin (as they surely will if that happens).",3.0,2024-11-12,United Kingdom 
R22LYPL0CH1Z1F,Of late I have found my Echo Dot 3rd Gen being moved on a regular basis from the kitchen where it usually stands.  This has been because the carers we normally have for Mum due to her rapidly increasing dementia have been using it to get Alexa to play the type of music Mum has always loved.  So I felt it was time I got myself another Echo Dot which could replace the 3rd Gen.  Having checked the reviews on the Echo Dot 5th Gen I purchased it and it arrived on the evening of the day it was ordered.  This has been the simplest Echo device I've ever known to set up.  I turned bluetooth on before opening the Alexa app on my phone and clicked on the set up new device and nothing seemed to happen until I noticed that the 5th Gen was showing as being online.  So I asked Alexa what was the time and she immediately responded.  Never before have I had an Echo device which has gone online within about a minute.The sound is excellent with a better bass sound than the Echo Dot 3rd Gen and it can be clearly heard and picked up wherever I am in the kitchen.  Not only that but if I'm on the opposite side  of the kitchen to the speaker Alexa picks up any commands even when the radio's playing.  A most welcome addition to my home.,5.0,2024-11-22,United Kingdom

I bought this one to replace one of the lighter Echo Pops which is on the bedside table & which I kept knocking over. It was fine for the first few weeks, but for some reason this one now  keeps switching to mute.I have them as they’re ideal for switching lights on & off which might make me sound lazy but I have rheumatoid arthritis & it’s currently active in my hands, elbow & especially my shoulders making lifting my arms even switch height, difficult & painful.When setting it up I used the cable from the Echo Pop as it fitted & worked fine for a good few weeks but now I’m wondering if that might be the problem. Thing is my plugs are under the bed so I’ll have to wait til one of my sons can unplug the old (maybe no more than a year old) plug & fit the one that came with it.Other than that I had no complaints. The sound was excellent, possibly even better than the Pop, which are very good & at £22 this seemed excellent value for money.

Can't particularly comment on the sound as ours is configured to use the surround system rather than the internal speaker.Eero integration is listed in the specs but again, our Wi-Fi throughout our house with the Eero Wi-Fi setup has never had any issues so I would have never seen an improvement.  It does show up in the Eero app though so must be doing something.In summary it does what we expect from an Alexa device, no bells or whistles that we've noticed but to my (badly degrading) eye it looks better than the old puck devices.",4.0,2024-09-22,United Kingdom 
R1HB5OIFWPLE91,"I have used the cheap Echo Flex devices for a while and having recently moved decided to treat myself to these echo dots 5th gen to get better sound quality and make use of the ultrasound motion detection to turn on my hallway lights when i come through the front door and to be able to listen to decent sound on a better speaker.The sound quality is without doubt great but the mic on these two dots I bought are extremely poor  compared to the cheap Echo flex's. I have one dot in my lounge and one in my bedroom, plus one flex in my kitchen and one in my hallway. Standing in my living room with the doors closed and an echo dot just 3 feet away from my mouth and I ask a question, my voice is picked up not by the mic on the dot I am standing next to but from mics on either the echo flex in the kitchen which is about 20 feet away behind a closed door or the hallway one which is about 15 feet away behind a closed door. Calling support, just gets you a ""Reset it and it should be fine"" response.The ultrasound motion detector is useless in as much that it works and can be used to turn lights on when it detects motion but then those lights will remain on for 30 minutes after no motion is detected as this is a fixed time set by amazon and can not be changed. This makes the motion detection useless. The motion detectors on the echo flex devices can be set to a time to trigger routines and can turn my lights off just one minute after no motion is detected.There is also an issue with the temperature detectors, they work but the software has a problem with voice commands. I have named my two dots as ""living room"" and ""bedroom"". If I am in the living room and ask what is the temperature in this room. Alexa will tell me the living room temperature is xx. If I ask what is the temperature in the bedroom she will reply the temperature in the bedroom is xx. All good right.However if I go into the bedroom and ask the dot in there ""what is the temperature in this room, she will reply ""The temperature in the living room is xx"". Even though that dot is in the bedroom and assigned to the bedroom and called the bedroom dot, unless I specify I want the bedroom temperature, she will always give me the living room temperature.Finally the volume control is not ideal, these devices can be loud  but only have 10 steps of volume. Using this for sleep sounds will not give me a desirable volume with 2 being too low and 3 being too loud. You can not set volume to say 25% only 20 or 30. Surely it can't be difficult to set volume to a percentage value other than multiples of 10.Overall the devices are good, but not being able to change the no motion detected time and it being set at half an hour makes the motion sensor useless. This should be user definable in the app. The mic issue wont be a problem if you only have one echo device. The temperature setting when reported I was told will be passed on to the developers (not holding my breath on that one).",3.0,2024-04-02,United Kingdom

It was on offer for around £22 so for the price it is worth it, but I doubt I would be happy paying the full price given that I am a bit disappointed in it's capabilities.The primary reason for choosing this to replace the older one was simply due to it having a motion sensor and temperature sensor built in. I figured it would be nice to be able to use this for the automation of lighting and heating depending on occupancy.However, the motion sensing ability is very poor, I've tried placing it in different locations, used different sensitivity and range settings but found that it was always very hit and miss... usually more of a miss to be honest.Anyway, I reverted back to using a ceiling mounted PIR sensor.The temperature sensing is okay, not very accurate, can be over 1 degree C out and slow to respond to sudden changes in temperature so definitely no use for controlling a smart heater.The only positive is the sound quality, it really is a big improvement over the 3rd generation model, surprising how such a small device can produce such a full and rich sound.Overall, based on the low price that I paid, it's okay, and maybe a future firmware update might improve the issues with the sensors.",3.0,2024-11-28,United Kingdom

R102FPO7272O2N,"I just want to start the review making sure people are not confused by the Amazon description. This headset does not have active noise cancelling and you will hear everything around you while using it. What it will do is cancel background noise picked up by your microphone while you are talking to someone else to make sure your voice is clear.With that out of the way... this is a great headset, with good range and the microphone sounds slightly better than some of the competitors at this price point. I was surprised by the sound quality and it's more than adequate to play music while working. In terms of ergonomics, it's ok but not amazing and I can wear it for multiple hours without feeling uncomfortable. It stays in place just fine if you don't move your head too much but it starts to fall a little if you look up and down due to its weight.Battery life is very good and it was extremely easy to connect to a Mac, Windows laptop and an iPad. It can hold two active connections at the same time which works great between the Windows laptop and the iPad but not that well between the Mac and the PC which seems to be a problem based on other reviews.The USB dongle worked fine and has a little LED light that shows whether you are muted/unmuted or in a call. The Windows software is easy to use and configure and it detected everything without problems. Updating the dongle and headset to the latest firmware versions just worked.It's a premium (expensive) headset but it delivers, I definitely recommend it.",5.0,2022-02-23,United Kingdom

R1DZ2RAJ57XPBG,"Simply the best headphones I've ever had! The quality of the brand is unbeatable.I have mild/moderate hearing loss, so not just any headphones will meet my needs.

In this one, the volume is very loud and clear, and I don't even need to reach the highest volume. :)The bass is strong, another positive point for me.The battery is amazing, it lasts a super long time. I think I spent a whole week working, and only at the end did it go from High to Medium. I have had them for the past 3-4 weeks and I only charged it once.The integration with MS Teams is perfect, and you only need to raise the microphone to mute it and lower it to unmute. Love that!I don't usually use work headphones in my daily life, but these are so good that I use them even when I'm not working.I connect to my phone via Bluetooth and to my work laptop using the dongle - which has a working light.The price is not low, but you are paying for a high-quality product.I highly recommend it!",5.0,2024-03-22,United Kingdom

R2IJLKZV6Y77K5,"Been using decent quality wired headsets for years, these are an expensive step up. The audio is clear for both calls and music, battery life is good (35 hours with constant daily use). The microphone is excellent, overall a  good purchase if a little pricey.I've been working in a small temporary office at home with my wife, we are both loud and our calls often overlap. The mic is great at excluding extraneous noises, however, I can clearly hear my wife talking when I'm on a call and similarly my wife can hear my music or conversions (at normal levels). I had expected better noise cancelling at this price.I didn't buy the cradle but the USB-A (to USB-C) cable is more than adequate. I wear these most of the day and despite having a big head they sit relatively comfortably on the ear. There is a decent amount of padding around the cup and the man made fabric isn't sweaty!I have Bluetooth'ed to both my mobile and laptop and have had ZERO connection issues, indeed I have used every comms app out there without issue (Mainly MS Teams). It switches app, picks-up, re-connects effortlessly.I regularly wander off to make a brew or food during calls - just turn off the video, mute by moving the boom mic up and wander off to do whatever, jump back in at any time. I like this a lot, I've even sat in the sun at the back of the garden 30m or so away.5 star overall despite weaker than expected noise cancelling (btw My wife sits about 1m away)",5.0,2020-07-02,United Kingdom 
R3UERML970LU6Q,"It is good overall, connects well to multiple devices, sound quality is good, microphone is good, no lag.

R14JQE4KWJ4WN2,"Before buying this headset I read the other reviews and was concerned that there was a number of 1 star reviews with various grievances, but I've been pleasantly surprised using it.You will need to update the firmware on the headset and usb dongle in order to use it to it's full. For some, this fact alone appears to be a big issue, but I feel this is now relatively standard for IT equipment i.e. you need to keep up to date with the latest drivers, software etc.The update of the firmware was relatively straightforward. You can update the headset directly from your mobile phone using the jabra app and the bluetooth connection. Alternatively you can download the Jabra direct software and update it that way. The usb dongle can only be updated through your PC/Mac using the jabra direct software, so if you only have a work computer without install rights then this could be annoying for you. I initially tried updating the firmware using my Mac but this failed. There appeared to be an issue with the software on the Mac, so just to be aware. I used my Windows 10 PC to upgrade the firmware without incident, it was very easy.The sound quality on the headset is good to my ears, I am no audiophile but I can't tell much difference to my fancy AKG headphones when listening to music.  Others have complained of the volume fade up as sound starts, but I can't say this has bothered me personally. My use case is for skype and teams calls for work and listening to music etc, but if you want to use it for dictation then maybe this will be more of an issue.The 'noise cancelling' effect of the headset are pretty limited. It does not have active noise cancelling technology but rather uses passive noise cancelling such as the shape of the earpiece etc (according to their website). To be honest, I don't notice much difference than a decent pair of over the ear headphones, so if you expect perfect silence while wearing them then prepare to be disappointed. You will likely have to spend some serious cash to get very good noise cancellation.I've had no issue with connection using both the USB dongle and the Bluetooth function. I've tried connecting to my laptop (dongle) and phone (bluetooth) at the same time, but to be honest find this fiddly as it's not always obvious which device you are controlling when using the buttons on the headset. For example, I wanted to turn the volume down on my PC but it changed the volume on my phone instead. When you are in an active call on one device, usually this becomes the dominant connection. But for me, it's simpler to have it only connected to my work PC.I bought the Microsoft teams verified version and after the firmware update is recognized as such by the Teams software. This means the central function button on the headset will call up teams, answer calls etc as expected.The call quality has been good in use, and is as clear as my previous wired headset. Much of this is down to internet connection as much as the headset itself, so not much to report in this respect. The microphone is short and so is not located in front of my mouth as my old headset was but it picks up the audio just fine. This is actually good as you can sip water etc with the mic down.Someone else had complained about the ergonomics of the design, but I have not has any issues. They are comfortable to wear and lightweight. They do not grip my head tightly, so if you move around a lot they will fall off, but for sitting at a computer, or walking normally around the room they are fine. Sure you can't do HIIT wearing them, but they are not designed with that in mind.Another reviewer had complained about the build quality, but again I can't see much wrong with them. Sure they are made from plastic.... but most products of this type are. They are light, but this suits me as I don't want to wear a heavy headset for 8 hours a day. My only comment is that the adjustable band appears to be medium to large in size, so if you have a small head they might not fit very well.The battery has lasts for multiple days use after a charge, which is much longer than my other Bluetooth headphones. I have not had them long enough to comment on the robustness of the design to wear and tear or whether the charging cycle will reduce the battery life significantly, so I will update this review in a few months with comments on this.Would I recommend them? For the price I paid for them (£135) I would say they have been good. When I looked at the alternative wireless stereo headsets this was one of the cheaper options, and I think they are fit for purpose. Are you going to be blown away by them... no. They do what they've been designed to do, and they do it to a reasonable price point.For working in an office/WFH where you want a wireless headset for calls and listening to music then I would recommend. For other use cases, such as gaming or exercise etc you will want to look elsewhere.",4.0,2020-10-23,United Kingdom 
R2JUUUM7GMZ5LA,"I initially bought a cheaper wireless headset but was unhappy with the sound quality, so after much research, I got this at 3 times the price of the last one.The sound quality is significantly better, no more muffled voices. They are even ok for listening to music but still not quite as good as a dedicated set of music headphones at similar prices.The included USB-C dongle is fairly small, so should not cover up nearby USB sockets. It manage to keep a very good connection with the headset at all times. You can use your computer's built in bluetooth, but apparently the dongle is generally better according to youtube.You can pair the headset with the dongle AND to a phone at the same time. The dongle takes priority, so if there's a call on the computer with the dongle, it will switch to the computer call automatically.Fit wise, it's fairly comfortable, I have a large head and a lot of headsets are too tight, these are not too tight.Took a star off because you can't wear the headset with the mic boom on the left, it only swivels correctly when it is worn on the right hand side.",4.0,2024-10-30,United Kingdom

R9WLXS4DC8SBD,"If you are considering the stand option - Be aware there is no advantage to the stand. You still have a USB-A connection to a computer or hub in order for it to operate and charge your headset. It looks fancy, but you also get a USB-A to USB-C connection cable which can plug directly into your headset anyway. The stand just takes up space for no practical gain. That said, I like mine :)2) I got the USB-C connector for my headset rather than the USB-A one. Simply put, USBC is the future. I had hoped it meant higher through put and therefore better quality but at the end of the day, it's just using bluetooth not 2.4GHZ so the quality is the same with either connector. The connection range is good.3) I absolutely love the fact that I have this connected to both my PC and my iPhone at the exact same time and it works with either. Play music on your phone, and when a call comes in on teams on your PC, just push a button or pull down your mic, and it'll answer the call. Also does the same when I got a call on whatsApp or any other coms software. The only advantage getting a Microsoft teams version gives you, is that the side button brings teams into focus to be honest. But since most work places are using teams today, might as well take that advantage!4) They are comfortable, perhaps a little too tight, even though my head isn't very wide, but I do wear glasses and I can feel the pressure on them over my ears. But I've had them for less than 24 hours, maybe they will relax a bit after time.5) USB-C to USB-C works fine, but I've not tested to see if it charges any quicker. Just confirmed it works.6) Jabra software on the PC is cool. I've had it before in a work place and it got annoying there where it had a weekly update. But I think this was enterprise device management software. The version I have now is much nicer, and it updates the devices (receiver and headset and stand). Just make sure you plug the headset into the stand or cable when updating the headset.7) The headband isn't very big. Although the headphones themselves are fairly heavy. But one of the issues I have with most headphones, is the massive gap between the headband and the side of my head (just above the ear) I have a shaved head, and this massive space just looks ruddy stupid on my headphones. But not here!8) The carry case. It's actually really nice. Apple (Airpod max) should look on and think ""wow, thats how we should have made our carry case!""The bad......1) The microphone boom isn't extendable. I have a beard, and if I pull the mic down to the perfect position then as my face moves while talking, the beard scrapes on the mic. I have to raise the boom up a little to stop this happening.2) Order the black colour! Trust me on this. I got the other colour and it's like having one of those old PC's from the 90's which was the ""alternative to a black case"". It is a horrid colour that your granma might paint the livingroom in.3) There has been the very rare time where I go to play music on my phone and for some reason pressing play just doesn't work. Only happens when these headphones are connected up. Other than this it's very receptive to incoming calls and reacts very well.",4.0,2021-06-16,United Kingdom 
R17R8L1ANS0T1K,"Since lockdown, like many people, I’ve been working from home and spending a lot of time on Teams. When my old, wired headset packed up (truth be told, my dog found them and had a good old chew), I decided its replacement had to be wireless as I’m tired been chained to my laptop. I’d like to say that I did a lot of research, but I didn’t so I’m pleasantly surprised at how well this purchase turned out.The headphones aren’t the cheapest, but I’ve come to believe that you get what you pay for. If you factor in how much time you are going to be using them, then this is probably a bargain. I also managed to get it from Amazon Warehouse which helped!I purchased the USB-C headset without the charging station and when I unboxed, I was surprised at how well made the headset felt. Everything these days seems to be cheap plastic. The headband is cushioned at the top to make wearing it more comfortable and it expands to fit all head sizes. I love the feel of the soft carry case and it will offer some protection if you commute to the office.Setting up was easy or so I thought. I just connected via Bluetooth without using the dongle which proved to be a mistake. I got really frustrated trying to get the headset to sync properly with Teams. If I raised the microphone arm or pressed mute on the headset, it wasn’t reflected on Teams even though I was muted. It was frustrating and I thought that I would have to just live with it but eventually, I decided to use the dongle and download Jabra Direct software. After that, all the headset functions were in sync.I love the fact that I am connected to two devices simultaneously which means I switch between phone and teams calls without any difficulty. The LED lights mean that people know when I’m busy, but this can be switched off if that isn’t something that you like. I’m still getting to understand all the different LED colours so worth reading the manual something I confess; I don’t normally bother (see above).Overall, it’s a nice headset, however for me, it has one flaw, I just don’t find them that comfortable. I have to say that I prefer enclosed headphones and they hurt my ears after a period, and I wonder if I should have splashed out and bought the Jabra Evolve2 85.  As I said before you get what you pay for!",4.0,2023-06-17,United Kingdom 
R3KZ4U05EMEXDI,"Disappointed . These were quite a lot more expensive that that others I looked at. I therefore expected better quality. The good points first - they are light , the sound is good and the mic quality is good.  However I found the fit really slack and loose. Like if you tilt your head downwards it stars to slide off (im a male with an average size head) . I also found them quite bulky and look like something a teenager would wear to play games. They didn’t look professional in my opinion. The case it comes in is like a grey square cloth…personally thought it looked cheap. They  connected to my phone without any hassle and the Jabra app is nice to use. I understand these also come with a 2 year warranty which is good. However  the main reason I bought these was for online meetings and the dongle wouldn’t connect to the headset. I may have just been unlucky here as probably just this particular headset was faulty. Amazon are usually great at dealing with returns so no worries there. However overall I would not recommend.

R19AHRWL982RGD,"For the past year I’ve been using the original Evolve 65… I found that they felt loose and kept slipping and the ear pads lacked enough padding - plus they felt cheap and horrible considering  the price.I was willing to pay full price so opted to get these from Amazon warehouse - granted the box was a bit scuffed up but the content inside was all accounted for and absolutely fine.As for the headphones themselves -Pros:1. Although no active noise cancelling like other premium headphones, the additional padding and material used really do help reduce background noise (something the originals didn’t do)2. The padding…there’s more of it so they feel more comfortable on the ears without plastic parts feeling pressed against you.3. It has a silicon gel cushion on the headband that not only adds comfort but reduces your headset shifting about easily.4. A more premium feel - I’m almost certain they are still plastic BUT they have been coated in a rubber texture.5. Buttons. You have the mute button to the front where as the others are to the back. All with easy access. (Note: my model has a teams button but currently we don’t use it so I have no idea what this is supposed to do)Cons:The main one is this only fits one way…which is annoying. As I’m on the phone whilst using a computer I prefer to control the headset with my left hand as I’m using the mouse in my right. (Previous models could be adapted to use left or right handed). This is a real shame.Overview:Nice decent headphones that are comfy to wear and definitely a huge upgrade from the previous model - are they worth the RRP … definitely not. If you can get them for around £100 or under then they are worth it if you use them daily.In the box you do get a nice leatherette pouch that jabra sell for £85 separately - maybe this should be a cheaper case to reduce costs.I didn’t get the stand - but was shocked jabra are selling this for £75.

The audio comes back on after a few seconds, but I have already missed bits of an important conversation. It is very annoying during interactive meetings. I have seen a few posts in different forums about the same issue. In the beginning I thought it could be due to firmware not being up to date and would sort itself out after a few rounds of updates. Within one month of use I have seen two rounds of firmware updates but the problem hasn't gone away. I then contacted Amazon customer service and they suggested me to reset the headset. Yes, resetting the device solved the problem, but only for a couple of days. They then suggested me to contact Jabra customer service. Jabra suggested me to reset both the device and the USB dongle. I did that but again the problem disappeared only for a day. They then suggested me to disable the ""USB selecting suspend setting"" in Advanced power setting option. But that didn't solve the problem. So, unfortunately, I had to return this otherwise excellent headset. I wonder if others faced the same problem.Apart from the problem mentioned above, I also think there is a lag between audio and video when I watch Netflix or YouTube. Note that I also have Jabra 20 wired headset and that does not show any of the problems mentioned above.The material used for ear pad does not seem made of very high quality stuff considering this is a £135 device.The Jabra software is not up to the mark. I have two device connected - my PC and my android phone. I chose the option to not automatically answer any call in the phone when I am on another call on Teams in my PC. But it doesn't work. During important Teams call, if some spammer calls me on my mobile, it answers that one automatically suspending my Teams call at work. This is a very annoying thing and I couldn't get my head around this problem.I am not an audiophile but to me sound quality seems excellent when I listen to music or watch a film. I also like the option to mute the microphone by pushing the boom upwards. I am not too bothered about noise cancelling feature since this is an on-ear headset not over-ear. The ability to listen to my own voice during conversation was nice. Although the accompanied SW allows user to control the amount of own voice being heard, I have not found it has any significant impact. Battery life is excellent. I can go through the whole week of extensive use without charging and still find about 10% battery life left.Anyway, Jabra still need a lot of work to sort out the problems mentioned above. I will stick to the wired version for the time being.",3.0,2021-05-06,United Kingdom 
R146IRSC3HXBM7,"I wanted to upgrade my Jabra headset and purchased these which were nice and robust, unfortunately you can only wear them with the controls on the right side so being left handed this was unsuitable!!

R3EWG3UPJJ51A9,"Before installing the software I used this headset for a couple of days, and it comes with some infuriating defaults. It's a wireless headset so I thought I could put on some music and go make a cup of tea, but no, it has a motion sensor in it so if you wander off it'll pause your music. It also seems to auto pause if it detects noises in the room with you, so it's kinda the opposite of a noise cancelling headset. It cancels your music so you can listen to the noise.It would also answer calls when I picked the headset up. Which just meant I joined about 10s earlier than I would have, but nevertheless irritating, and it joined by default with the webcam on, so everyone got to watch me sit down and get settled.Oh and the robot voice lady who shouts MICROPHONE MUTED whenever you click the mute button in teams and MICROPHONE ACTIVE when you unmute. Even does it when you raise/lower the boom arm.After installing the software, this could all be solved. Robot lady became a subtle beep, all motion controls can get in the bin, it now works at range and doesn't pause randomly.Only thing is, the software is also kinda garbage. It works fine if you don't plug the headset into your pc to charge, because then it detects it as a new device on fitmware 0.0.0 and will remind you every 10 minutes to update. Also, if you do click update on this particular message, it'll cause the software to soft lock with a warning that 'disconnecting the device could damage it' I left it for 2 hours before force closing it.",4.0,2022-04-14,United Kingdom

R3DX09OD9YJ2WR,"They arrived 10 days ago, I did not charge them out of the box and have only had to charge them once. I use the headset for work during the day with Microsoft teams, between 4-5 hours of voice calls. Evening I use it for entertainment, mainly movies or games, another 3-4 hours of usage, in total between 7 to 10 hours per day. I have only had to charge them once since bought, currently battery is at 80%. I like the fact that it goes in to standby mode when I take it off my head and place it down. The audio does take a second to kick in when you put them back on but its something you can get use to. Team integration works as described.It did not take me long to get use to it, headset is comfortable during prolonged usage.Microphone is very clear much better than the expensive Sony headphones I had previously according to my colleagues and none of them can hear my kids screaming, dog barking nor my wife shouting at all of them!Noise cancellation is brilliant, a little too good, both the kids and the dog has managed to scare me a few times as I did not hear them come in.Sound quality is very good for both calls and media, maybe not suitable for an audiophile but it certainly meets my needs.The desk stand is very handy, a little awkward to get the contact points in to place but I will get use to it.Note that if you connect via Bluetooth to your pc or laptop it will not register with the Jabra app, you need to use the dongle that is included, its sort of hidden inside the headset pouch which I recommend.",5.0,2023-07-17,United Kingdom 
RFHWXVUE79KK8,"I was getting sick of getting tangled in wires and my old headset died so I treated my ears to these.  They are quite heavy on the head but comfortable.. they don’t slip forward or fall off every time I move or bend down. Battery life is pretty good,  I’ve gotten well over a week from a full charge with still medium battery life.  Noise cancellation is pretty good and customers are saying they can hear me well. They have had a couple of glitches but that’s to be expected given I’ve not read the instruction.. it is a USB C connector so I needed an adaptor to fit in my surface pro as my dock is full. But I’d already got one of them.. comes with a felt pouch.

RINUZF1WC76J4,"This is a good product, started with a small “hick-up” as I thought they weren’t compatible with my work phone system (Cisco) and was a bit disappointed. But, they did work as in the end found out my system was having a “bad week” and all colleagues had issues. Took one star out for comfort.. maybe depends on everyones shape of their heads… but I experienced a slight pain (I keep them positioned on my left ear) on my right side due to headband not having a foam protector (which I think its a slight oversight from makers for the cost!). Bought one separately and had it improvised (headband foam protector)! Poorly thought from that angle as this is an item that it is considered to wear for hours on end and they should’ve taken in consideration the comfort too! Quality of performance is okay and works as it is intended. Noise cancellation is okay (found that I am talking louder when in office when I have them on, ha!). Has a few features that are quite helpful, answer the phone while lowering the mic, button to say the level of battery and confirm connection etc.Hopefully they will last a while (have them for just over a month now) as they are quite pricey (for me anyway - I know there are some more expensive then this!).",4.0,2022-02-11,United Kingdom 
RVNULPIPDGYHR,"Very well made and comfortable to wear. Really good sound quality for calls and for music. I have these paired with my laptop for Skype and Teams for Business calls, and with my mobile for calls and Spotify. Don't be put off by them being 'optimised for MS Teams' as they work just as well when not being used for Teams. Some nice features, such as muting when you move the mic boom up. Good call management when you are paired with two devices. The app is nice to use, and gives some customisation options. Battery life is really good. I hammer these, and I get 2 weeks between charges. The volume has a good range, both low and high. I find most headphones don't go low enough with my Samsung S9, especially with my Mum, who shouts. These go down to a very low sound level.The range using the supplied dongle is extremely poor - about 3m in a house. Nowhere near the claimed range. You can't wander into another room whilst on a conference call for example. With very my old Plantronics set I could leave the house and get to the end of the garden whilst remaining connected.They are a little on the bulky side compared to other headphones. No use for running, or vigorous walking, as they move around too much and easily fall off, even tilting your head causes them to fall off. Doesn't always automatically connect to my Samsung S21 Ultra. I often have to turn the headset power off and on to connect.",4.0,2020-11-03,United Kingdom 
RP1U105UIE8HO,"Initially the price of this headset (and others in this price range) was slightly off-putting. Just how much better could it be than a cheaper headset or indeed my trusty wired Sennheiser. The answer is... quite a bit.The headset has a nice solid feel to it, with excellent padding on the ears and the headband (something frequently overlooked). As I'm generally on calls or meetings for 4+ hours in a day this is actually quite relevant. Also relevant is the (optional) audible warning and reminders when you go on or off of mute - as well as the two ways of doing this.Customisable functions, through an app, is a nice touch - such as turning a 'busy' light on the side of the headset on or off.Battery life has been good, I generally charge it every two to three days and I rarely let it get to a low battery warning, meaning it could probably manage most of the week without attention if I were less talkative.I got the option configured for MS Teams and it has been quite useful to work with some of the utility button functions built in to that. Being able to wander off and make a coffee whilst in a meeting is an unexpected bonus and doesn't have any noticeable impact on the sound quality at about a 7-10m range.Would I buy one of these to see out the rest of lockdown if I didn't plan to use it beyond that? Probably not - there are plenty of high quality wired units for around half the price. However, I got this because I anticipated using it for several years to come and, so far, there is nothing to indicate that it won't be capable of meeting that expectation.Overall, it is a good investment if you expect to use a headset regularly and want something high enough quality to last well and be comfortable for extended use. There are probably better units out there but for most of us the differences would likely be splitting hairs. If you want a solid, competent effort then this is one worth considering.",5.0,2021-02-09,United Kingdom 
R2WNEYVZOXM7O9,"I bought this about 18 months ago and use it every work day, I have it connected through the dongle to .my work laptop and to my personal phone via Bluetooth.All my work calls mostly go through teams with a lot being video calls.Main reason why I choose over the other models at the time is for the noise cancelling feature, this works well and have been pleasantly surprised.I like the fact that you know audio is off when you push the mic up, can't be overriden within teams.I work from home most days, having tbr red light on the ear piece is great for indicating your muted to others but also signalling your in a call.I pop these in the nice case that comes with it when taking trips to thr officee.I am not looking at replacing these anytime soon, showing little to no ware but I guess that is largely down to how they are looked after.",5.0,2024-02-08,United Kingdom 
R1BY8LSVXHHBVN,"Glad I got this version - USB C Bluetooth connector.My laptop has no standard USB slots, so I was going to have to look for another USB adapter.The headset itself is excellent. Sound quality is second-to-none. Perfect for Teams calls. It natively has several features for teams call that I like:- action button for teams on the side- as you swivel your mic up and away, it tells you mic muted, and also lets you know the position of your mic if you want it to.I did find when I placed the headset directly over my ears it tended to hurt them after a couple of hours. I adjusted them slightly and released the tightness and moved them off my ears slightly and that solved the issue. It won't affect everyone, it's just because these are not headphones that encompass the ear, they sit on the ear. Just something to think about. I suppose in used to wearing for 4 hours with ear-muff style headsets...I just need to learn these are better for meetings.That said Ive used for long periods of listening to music whilst coding, and I can't complain now.

R1YPL074TA6UN5,"I thiught I'd give some informative insights as I had such questions when i was looking for a headset.This headset has helped with the sudden spike in conference calls I'm on! And has been so useful!Battery usually lasts a week - which is great considering I'm on calls for about 4-5 hours a day and I also listen to a bit of background music during the day as well... It takes about an hour to fully charge, so pretty quick recharge. You can still use it whilst it's being charged (type-c connection)The Mic is really good, drowns out quite a few sounds. Made more for office sounds eather than home (2 year old demanding a chocolate will be picked up!). The Mic rotates to both sides so you can place the headset on either ear.The Mic goes on mute if its up right and you can answers calls by either pressing the button on the headset or bring the mich down to answer the calls.You can also link it up to 2 devices at a time (e.g. laptop and mobile phone). Although only use one at a time.The headset lights read when I'm on a call. Purple when I'm not.The teams function is purely to answer calls and end calls using the button on the headset. It's been useful when I've had my headset on and I'm making tea or changing a nappy, i just press the teams button or bring the mic down.You don't need to use the USB dongle, you can connect via Bluetooth but the dongle enables the additional features (mic answering, teams functions etc).I was a bit conscious about the price, but it's a great investment given that I've used it everyday for almost a year now!

Sure, they run a bit warm on long (1-3h) calls from my own body heat against the pads but that’s fine.Battery life is really good. I’ve got a usb-c cable on the desk for my iPad anyway so I just plug them in every few days.The jabra desktop software (I’m using Windows 10) is good, easy to understand and is often updated - on install there was a big firmware update and yesterday there was a big software update.

The test included playing a podcast from a speaker close to me to simulate a very loud co-worker in a small office setting. I could make out what was being said on the podcast using this but the Jlab blocked all of it. No1 was the Poly voyager 4320 which was not much better than the Jlab.This was corroborated by co-workers who previously never had an issue while I was using the Jlab.,4.0,2023-01-21,United Kingdom 
R33X702SY5LU3H,"Only had this a few weeks, so far very impressed. Very good sound quality, excellent build and is working flawlessly with my Mac.

R2B35YEZ6CIUT5,"Pros- Battery life is great.  Not only the usage time, also the storage time with power switch off, the battery will not be obviously drained by itself.- Sound is good, it is pretty satisfied on both sides during calls, especially compared with usual music headphones.- Bluetooth dongle connection is smooth and fast.- Overall built quality is good, and pouch is nicely designed with a little pocket inside to hold the usb dongle.Cons- Headband is too fit, needs trying different positions to let it lay on the head comfortably.  However, once it is set, the comfortability is still ok for a conference session.- Microphone boom arm turning angle is limit, it cannot be turned to another side like previous one.  Also the boom arm shape is fixed, not able to adjust.- Jabra Direct desktop app is a bit buggy, like it cannot do the update properly.",4.0,2020-09-25,United Kingdom 
RPBNK0MIUTPDR,"I bought these so I have bulletproof sound quality on Teams calls when using a Windows laptop (I just couldn’t get good results with my AirPods).To be fair to Jabra, when using the USB wireless dongle (not sure what to call it), this is achieved. The sound I hear, and from what I can tell, the sound people are hearing from me, is rock solid.However, I was expecting to be able to use these with my iPhone for phone calls and conference calls. So far this has been quite disappointing. The documentation is very poor, and I had to fiddle around for a while to make them work together, even though it was relatively easy to make the Bluetooth connection. Once I finally got them working, the connection wasn’t very stable.

If there is a lot of noise in your vicinity you will hear it. But, if using for professional work then your setup is probably in an office or home office and low level background noise is not a problem.They are extremely comfortable, and appear well made and durable.The headset voice tells you your battery status and your mute/unmuted position.The headset connects either via the usb, as shown in photo, or by Wi-Fi.I tend to use the usb for work, but Wi-Fi on my personal iPad, I have not noticed a performance difference.Personally I would not use them for music or tv, they are best suited for work voice calls.I love them!",5.0,2021-11-03,United Kingdom

R1YPVOWZYH3W9S,"Firstly these are not noise cancelling despite the item title. Upon further investigation they have what the manufacturer laughably calls ""Passive Noise Cancellation"" which means you wear them over your ears, so they deaden the sound a bit. Like every other over the ear headset then.Secondly these are really uncomfortable. This is subjective as some seem to find them comfortable enough, but I could not find a position for the top band that sat comfortably without pressing down on my head. The material is rubbery and plasticky, which may be hard-wearing but it doesn't feel nice. Any knock or contact to the headset while wearing and the sound goes right through you. This is especially evident if you try to use it with the charging cable attached. Every motion causes the cable to move and causes a creak in your ears. Horrible. Even without the cable there's a lot of plasticky creaking going on.The buttons aren't labelled, so there's a bit of trial and error involved unless you download the PDF manual and plough through it and memorise it - this isn't what you want when answering calls.The sound quality was okay, but no better than okay.One positive was the ""Sidenote"" feature to enable you to hear your own voice played into your ears while on a call. This is missing from most headsets and the main reason I went for this model - however you wouldn't know about it because it doesn't seem to be listed anywhere.Overall, extremely disappointed and returning the headset to Amazon.",2.0,2021-06-18,United Kingdom

But I had to return it immediately as it was simply unusable based on the size of the microphone arm. If you have a larger sized male head which I probably do, then this will not fit you. The arm came only half way down my cheek and furthermore it was pressed right against my skin. Impossible to use. It's a shame as a very cheap Jabra 20 that I owned previously was perfectly good in that regard with a much longer arm. So, just be aware that this model may not be suitable for many men.",3.0,2023-02-20,United Kingdom 
R2YJC8JH1PYJ8T,"So, like most people at the moment, I’m working from home and the wires office supplied headphones, whilst good quality were just too restrictive being wired in.

The sound quality is great, they’re comfortable, and they look quite stylish. Some of the features are really handy too such as lift to mute and the integrated call answer button.What really let’s these down though is the microphone itself. Having used it for one day everyone who I’ve spoken to has complained that I sound really far away in a tunnel, even though the microphone is right by my mouth in a non echoing room.I’ve been through all the settings I can find on both my laptop and anything device related and nothing has rectified it.

So people can’t hear me talk when she’s mid convo, but people can hear her talking during my conversations (when I’m not speaking). Sometimes it doesn’t connect as easily, but I just pull the usb connector out and push it back in. Battery life is really good so far - several days on standby. All-in-all very good and looks great.

Seeing as I'm mainly desk based at home now, I thought I'd go for an over the head set and bought a cheap one with a mic boom to see how it was. NOT GOOD is the answer. Everyone thought i was in the car and the call quality was terrible. Now that I've bought the Jabra, everyone is commenting on how great the call quality is and how clear my voice is!

One & only minor issue is you have to bend the microphone away from your mouth, and it slowly bends back.Full of really great touches - separate buttons for mute and volume mean no accidentally hanging up on calls. Power switch is an on/off slider, so I don't have to hold a multifunction button wondering when it's actually off. When you turn it on a voice tells you the battery status. Lifting the microphone mutes the call (and the voice confirms it).

I wear hearing aids that fit on my ear with amplifiers in the ear that allow sounds to pass by, and can wear mine whilst using the Jabra headset without interference or feedback. The Jabra's fit on my ear, not over it and so hearing aids collect sounds from outside and transmit them into my ears in addition to Headset sounds. I find that I have to generally use 60-70% volume on my headsets, my previous wired headset was set at about 14% with 100% being too noisy.

I thought it might be isolated to a single platform at first but I'm now had this issue in Zoom and Microsoft Teams. My colleagues tell me its very distracting and makes it quite hard to understand me.I believe the issue is with the Jabra Link 380 dongle, as if I use it directly via Bluetooth then then audio issues go away. Unfortunately, using it via Bluetooth on my Mac means that the UC features don't work - the whole thing is very limited when used directly connected via Bluetooth to a laptop (I'm not really sure why this limitation exists, but it does and it's a tad annoying).I think this headset has great potential but it needs some updates.

RWL3194M5SUAJ,"Ring reviews haven't always been positive over the years with stories of poor connections to the app and long delays before your phone notifies you of somebody being at the door.  This is all a thing of the past thankfully.Firstly, the set up process is super easy. You simply scan a code on the box or back of door bell and you'll be guided through each step from how to install the doorbell itself, to setting up the app on your phone and what each of the settings do.  Scan the QR code and follow the instructions on screen. There is a voice over coming out of the doorbell also to tell you when it's being set up and complete. Honestly, there is nothing difficult whatsoever about this and even if you don't get it (which you will!) then you can watch Youtube videos for more help.The hardest part is drilling the wall outside which if your like me and hate DIY will take forever. But that's because I'm awful at DIY and hate it!  However, I drilled four holes using the back plate as a guide, whacked in the plugs and screwed on the plate.  Perhaps Im not a DIY disaster after all. The wife needs to reward with a lifetime of chocolate for this!!Once the plate is on the wall, charging the ring doorbell is easy. It comes with an orange key shaped like a letter J...like a hook, which pressed into a hole underneath the doorbell to release it off the plate. You then bring it in and charge it up!As for how long it takes to charge...well...I've not done it from 0% upwards yet as it had about 85% charge when it arrived.  It comes with a cable for charging by the way.  I imagine it'll take a couple of hours to fully charge but do this later on at night when you're less likely to get visitors and you won't miss anybody at the door.There are many settings. You can share the doorbell with others, so once you've got it all set up on your phone you can share with others.  Do all the setting up on your phone first whilst the doorbell is indoors and on the table in front of you, otherwise you'll be in and out testing settings.You can have motion detection on and you SHOULD! When it detects a person or car etc it will record a short video until they leave the area.  You can have motion alerts on or off. I have the off because it drives me mad letting me know every time somebody stands in our driveway (our parking spaces are right up to the front of our houses..and our neighbour has to stand in our parking space when getting out of his car...so it would pick up his 'motion').  So I turned motion detection ON but motion 'alerts' off which means its recording anybody near the house and recording it but not actually telling me about it as it happens. Because it doesn't matter as I'm at home a lot and can see them from where I sit anyway. You'll need to play with this to suit.  But you can set your doorbell to HOME or AWAY. When home for example you can set up alerts as I've described above...but when Im away I press the away button and it can be set to notify me of anybody in the driveway for example (different settings you can tweak).  This is a great idea.We bought the Ring camera too for the back of the house and set up was easy and it works in tandem with the doorbell.  We also bought the Chime separately. I recommend this if for example you have guests babysitting and don't want them to have access to your doorbell's camera.  For example, the mother in law.... she doesn't need to see the camera when she's at her own house so why give her access to it? But without access to it she can't hear anything when somebody comes to the door unless you have a chime, because otherwise the doorbell is ringing the home owners phone!  So get a chime...they are brilliant!The camera quality is good.... don't expect 4K quality...you don't need it to be. As long as it's clear day and night, which it is, and you can see people's faces and car registration plates etc, then that's all you need. It's the same with a dash cam. You're not Steven Spielberg ... it needs to be clear but not 4K cinematic!!The app is great because you can see the wifi strength and battery power left.  How long battery lasts depends on the settings you use. If you have got it detecting movement constantly instead of on the lowest setting, and taking snapshots all the time then you won't get as long on the battery.  Wifi signal depends on where you're router is and the speed of your broadband. Lots of people have great broadband nowadays. We are on Full Fibre 500 which is fast, so even when the kids are draining the internet we still get good doorbell connection.We've never had it drop signal. With good internet, your phone will notify you of somebody being at the door within two seconds.  You can also set your phone to get drop down notifications when somebody is at  the door,  OR for your phone to actually ring like it's a phone call. We have it on the latter, as you're more likely to hear/see it and answer it as a call and can easily miss a notification.One cool thing is that if you have an Apple Watch, you'll see a photo of the person at your door appear on your watch when they press the door bell.You can choose from a ton of features including the ability to have Ant and Dec talk to them as soon as they press the doorbell to let them know you're on your way etc. There's xmas themes and plain chimes. Lots to choose from.Sound quality is good also. There's no latency, so you won't end up talking over each other like a terrible TV satellite link up because of delays.Another cool feature is being able to set ZONES. My neighbour was moaning that his ring doorbell was picking up the cars driving past in the street, but that's because he didn't select which ZONE should activate the motion sensor.  What this means is, during set up (and any point you like afterwards) you can see your driveway / street in the app and draw a zone on the screen where you want it to activate the motion alerts. For us, we want notifications when somebody is directly outside the door and in any of the two parking spots outside but NOT the neighbour's parking spots which are clearly visible as its a wide angle (fisheye) lens on the doorbell.  So we draw a blue shape around the area we want to be detected. This allows us to ignore anybody driving past on the street.Finally, there's a parcels alert which tells you when somebody is at your door with a parcel.The list goes on, and ironically I have to leave this review now to answer the door.Get the ring doorbell.....it's incredible and come a long way since V1 several years ago.My version is the latest one in a nice brown/copper colour.",5.0,2024-12-02,United Kingdom 
R2VYZ51AO64P26,Great product. Works seamlessly and super easy to setup unlike some other brands. The notifications are real time. Had issues with old doorbell from an other brand where I would only get alerts 15-20 seconds later and the person at the door would have left by then and it is not the case with Ring. The motion detection is accurate and you can set detection boundaries. The picture quality is one of the best I have seen and the night vision is good too. The app helps you connect to the wifi and has lot of features within that are configurable. The battery life is also good but its too early to comment on that since I have only had this for 1 month.,5.0,2025-03-04,United Kingdom

R1D57WTXK2Y332,"A good upgrade from the ring video doorbell gen 2 , I'm using this with the compatible solar panel and the battery life is superb,  it was a doddle to connect,  when I took the old doorbell off this one fitted into the same holes so was a really straightforward swap and using it with the solar panel is a game changer,  the battery is still on 100% a week later so hopefully it continues to stay charged with the solar panel.The alerts are excellent,  it picks up all movement in the garden and is also an excellent security device as well as a good doorbell,  it picks up the whole of my front garden and small playing field in front of the house so it's a good HD security camera as well as being great for parcel deliveries and missed calls.The video footage is excellent as is the playback of the footage through the day , I get alerts on my watch and phone so I can stay connected to any alerts,  missed parcels , people entering the front garden and it even picks up people on the small field so the motion detection is superb for a small video doorbell camera.I'm really impressed with the overall quality and performance so far.

R3DMR9VZWFDOUK,"Battery Life and Mounting was originally a concern when purchasing this product, but it has been amazing. I did have to purchase the adhesive mount alongside the doorbell to stick it to my door, but it has stuck well and i’ve not charged it in 2 months (down to  54% with regular activity).Have had a few issues with it being a shared device, for example if the doorbell is shared to a different user, alexas and other ring-capable devices cannot seem to automatically run routines when the doorbell is pressed, and in my case a firestick will not automatically show a preview.

The app is very comprehensive and options aren't difficult to find and adjust. I've linked this with both my Echo Show 5 and 8, meaning I can ask my Echo Shows to show me the view outside my front door.  I still have time left on my free trial period of the subscription, but I've already purchased the Standard tier at £7.99 a month so I have no break in service.  People have being griping about the paid sub, calling it a scam.  A scam always involves an element of deception or fraud.  The item description makes it quite clear that a paid subscription is needed to take full advantage of all the abilities of the doorbell, such as recording footage.  If you didn't take the time to read the description before you purchased the item, well, that's down to you.  If you did read it and didn't like the idea of having to pay, then why did you buy it in the first place?  And come on - £7.99 a month?  That's less than 1p a day.

The additional features such as motion/person/package notifications really make a difference.As we have a good Ring ecosystem at our home, it took minutes to install and set up. The mounting plate is the same drill fixings so it really was a quick swap over.",5.0,2025-02-08,United Kingdom

RLFOY1YMT70K3,"I purchased this bell for 2 reasons . 1) so I could monitor my front door for deliveries when I’m in the back garden, and also see who’s at my front door at night. 2) It’s a great security feature, because I can also see my car in the day and at night incase anyone should want to break into it.The quality is amazing! At first I was only seeing it in black and white at night, even though it was advertised as colour. I then realised that if I went into the doorbell settings, that I can now see it in full colour at night. So I’m really happy with it and now feel safer in my home.",5.0,2025-02-10,United Kingdom

As usual with anything electronic nowadays it needrd an update as soon as you power it up. Despite my reasonably fast internet connection this up date took more than an hour to complete, it did have several attempts too. In the end I discovered that linking it to Alexa was the problem, once I had removed that link the update was done quite quickly. I am overall impressed with the device and actual see no need to conect to Alexa, the app on my phone does all I need and it also connected itself to my Samsung smart things app, which means I can have the camera picture on my TV.

The second customer service rep understood me perfectly and  told me that they only light up if  a wired option used die to battery conservation.I Returned, it and got a Tapo D210 which lights up and you can buy an SD card so no need for a subscription. Plus you can record your own message on the Tapo for the caller to hear which I did not find in the Ring App.You can also set the motion detection to less sensitive and the video quality to lower or even infrared at night all of which save battery and do not exist with Ring.",3.0,2024-12-18,United Kingdom

R13FUEETZR5OQO,"This New Ring Battery Video Doorbell has officially turned me into the world’s most professional snoop—and I’m living for it. Not only can I monitor who’s at my door (like an overzealous security guard), but I’ve now got footage of every visitor who dares to knock. And let me tell you, the video quality? Amazing. It’s like watching a live movie, except instead of a plot, it’s just my neighbour’s dog barking at the wind.But here’s the real kicker: I can now playback the video of myself when I’m drunk, falling over and failing to get my key in the door. Who knew I’d need video evidence of my own clumsiness? I’ve had a couple of nights where I’ve definitely made a fool of myself, and now, thanks to this nifty little doorbell, I can revisit those moments in full colour. Let’s just say it’s a great reminder to maybe—maybe—avoid high heels after three glasses of wine. 🍷Setting it up was ridiculously easy (no tech degree needed), and the battery lasts ages, so I’m not constantly worrying about it dying at the wrong moment. If you’re into being a nosy neighbour, want to watch your own drunken escapades, or just like having a crystal-clear view of who’s at your door, the Ring Doorbell is your new best friend. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who loves spying on themselves as much as they love their security. 📹",5.0,2024-12-10,United Kingdom

If you're unwilling to pay for it, you end up with the most expensive doorbell in the world that doesn't even come with a physical chime!No person notifications and no video playback mean that unless I can use psychic powers, I'll never know if someone is at my door unless they ring it, which completely negates the safety aspect of investing in a ring doorbell.",3.0,2025-01-03,United Kingdom

It states do not apply to brick or painted plaster.Zero instructions on adding a replacement Ring doorbell to the existing app or how to remove the old one!  What?!!!?No guide to pairing the remote chime either.This is a hardwired via ring transformer.This  unit also has a quick release catch which can be done with a screwdriver in seconds.Not secure and can be stolen or broken by thieves within the time it takes you to say Stop!Luckily I am a senior experienced technical professional and an IT expert, so I figured it out myself.Good luck if you are not.One other issue is the old doorbell removal from the account.No mention of this anywhere, can’t be done it seems.You also have to change your ring membership and guess what?You can’t swap the door bell over in the account.Close one account, Open a new one(!)On a quality of image, it is better coverage, ie a wider picture and there are sensor zones now, everyone else will have covered this of course.It is a better product, except no thought went into upgrading the product whatsoever.This is unforgivable in a limited life product.",5.0,2024-11-23,United Kingdom 
R2B93W3HZHUS94,So I've had the doorbell a week or so and I've decided to return it. It kept sending 'somebody at the door notifications' so I look and no one is there playback the recording (which won't be possible when trial sub expires) and see people walking past on the path about 15 feet away. I reduce the sensitivity of motion detection and still it notifys me so I reduce motion agaian and again until it is an minimum I still receive noticies. I have a older smart phone dedicated to the bell' live view this ends every 30 minutes it also ends when ring website is under maintenance (which has been quite frequent. I ultimately purchased this to replace a cheap one I got 5 years ago and recently failed at a 1/3 of the price it did exactly the what I wanted without a stupid subscription.It would be a good device if it wasn't for the subscription design. Where you could use local storage (like the cheap one I had.Not impressed with this expensive pay per view doorbell. Stupidly hard to get up and running having to register at Ring before could use it took 3 attempts to get the chime working with it. Then the live feed cut off due to site maintenance?

R1S5QNZV2CPU0C,I like the Ring door bell camera products generally but this door bell and battery is one unit so while the door bell is charging there is no door bell coverage which isn’t the best.The old product had interchangeable batteries and therefore much more useful and a better product. Though the estimated time for the battery to last is 6-12 months? I’ll report back in due course to update my findings.Update: only had this doorbell 3 months and already recharged it twice so the estimated 6 - 12 months battery life is so wrong. This means that I’ve had to remove the security element from my front door on two occasions. At least with the previous doorbell I had continuous security by just changing the battery.

En mi caso particular, tengo una Red WiFi Mesh y cada dos por tres pierde la conexión con la Red doméstica (es el único aparato de la casa que hace esto), por lo cual la pantalla queda inutilizable en lo que se está quejando de no tener conexión siendo necesario desenchufarlo para poder apagar las alarmas.

R5TSOOFOIUJXI,"As a broke uni student, I needed a speaker that was cheap, loud, and wouldn’t require me to sell a kidney—this one delivered. Literally, Amazon delivered it in a day!!! I got the black coloured one!First off, this thing is LOUD. My upstairs neighbor, who normally stomps around like an elephant in heels actually complained that my music was too loud. Sweet revenge.The setup was ridiculously easy. Just connect, press play, and boom—instant party. It’s small enough to fit in my backpack, which means I can take it anywhere, from my dorm to the library. (just kidding… kinda).It’s perfect for small parties, especially indoors. Trust me, this thing turns a sad, awkward gathering into a full-on rave—or at least a decent karaoke night where nobody sounds good but nobody cares.For the price? Absolute steal. Worth it! I mean for the quality? Cmon now! It’s budget friendly too.",5.0,2025-03-10,United Kingdom

R1417KFVERHIU7,"I bought this speaker in January 2018 and it has been all over the world in all kinds of climates with me. As you can see from the pictures, it has seen some action so when I tell you this thing can take a beating and still keep going, believe me.Let's start with build quality. This thing is solid. Despite its small size, 164mm x 45mm x 55mm, it is quite weighty, which indicates good quality speakers inside it. The outer shell is tough, feels substantial and has a nice rubberised, tactile feel. The speaker grill is also substantial and tough, when you pick this thing up you have no doubts that it isn't going to break if you drop it. The controls are straightforward and take a little pressure to use, but this is a good thing since you can't accidentally activate them. I definitely felt confident that this would last and take some abuse and nearly seven years later, that confidence has been well and truly justified.The sound quality is impressively good for a speaker of this size. It actually sounds bigger, not like other units of this size that I've heard which sound thin and tinny. The bass is far better than I expected from something this small and the overall clarity of the sound is quite impressive too. It's capable of decent volume levels without distortion and is great for the pool, camping, and outdoor parties etc. I'm currently using mine as a laptop speaker and it's a massive improvement over the laptop's built-in speakers.The Bluetooth connection on this thing is very easy to pair and is extremely reliable. Once set up it will automatically seek and connect to the last device it was paired to when next switched on. If you need to pair it to another device, that is easy to do. There is no significant drop in audio quality over BT compared to wired.The battery life is pretty much as advertised, if not longer. Even after almost seven years, I'm easily getting 24 hours or so on a full charge. I mostly charge it overnight and haven't made an accurate measurement of charging times, but I think it's a couple of hours for a full charge. It does hold a charge for a long time, though. It has been weeks between uses on occasion, with no noticeable drop in usage time between charges.The unit here is basically the same as my seven-year-old unit. The speaker system is the same design and the outer casing is the same. I think the only difference is the upgrade from BT4 to BT5, which can only be an improvement over what was already an impressive BT system. I'd certainly buy another of these if/when mine dies.",5.0,2024-11-25,United Kingdom 
R23JGMH5W0TQOR,"Happy me. The Anker Soundcore A3102 is a cheapish basic Bluetooth speaker good for daily use. No issues when pairing, and it supports multiple devices. Compact size and portable. I use it to listen to background music whilst working from home and also to link with my firestick - old TV to enchance the sound.As other soundcore speakers/products the sound clarity isn't the best but it not bad either. I tried to add the device into the android souncore app but it's not supported (there is a newer speaker variant out there)I can confirm that the battery last for quite long. There are only two options either Bluetooth or connecting via an analog jack. Ideally I would like to be able to use a sdc memory, but for the price paid maybe I am asking a lot.When trying to increas bass the sound is slighly distorted -I actually noticed the same issue with another souncode speaker.Please note the charging port is the previous gen micro usb.",4.0,2025-01-24,United Kingdom 
R189Z9AEBQOYKY,"The main thing I want to tell you about this speaker is this - the battery life is INSANE!! I got nearly an ENTIRE year off 1 charge! Now granted, I was only using it lightly and not listening to music from dawn-til-dusk. Never the less though, that's still pretty incredible.The quality of the audio is excellent - thick, meaty bass and crisp clear highs.

R7XZMRINC9NPD,"I use this in the bathroom while showering, and it works well for audiobooks since it’s not too bass-heavy. However, for music, it sounds a bit flat, but considering the price, I can’t really complain—especially since my other speakers are at a higher price point.I mainly bought this because I didn’t mind it getting wet, but despite being IPX5 waterproof, I’ve noticed that if water splashes directly on it, the sound muffles and stops playing until it dries. It handles steam fine, but I have to keep it on the other side of the bathroom to avoid issues.Pros:Great for audiobooks & podcasts – Clear vocals, not too much bass.Affordable – Decent value for a budget waterproof speaker.Good battery life – Lasts ages on a charge.Cons:Not great for music – Sounds a little flat.Waterproofing is limited – Can handle steam, but direct splashes cause issues.Final Thoughts:If you need a budget-friendly, bathroom-friendly speaker for audiobooks or casual listening, this does the job. Just keep it away from direct water contact despite the IPX5 rating.",4.0,2025-03-11,United Kingdom 
RB4ML19AHRODG,"This ANKER bluetooth cordless speaker is small, leight-weight, powerful and a charge lasts a really long time. Pairing with my Linux-run laptop and my android phone was really easy and I love that I can now take my music into the kitchen or bathroom.For just under £20, this speaker is amazing. The only issue I have with it is that I find singing voices are not very clear on it. If I don't know the song, I might not understand all the lyrics, as they come out with too much ""base"" (not even sure, that's the right wording). That's why I only gave 4 stars.So far I've only tried it in my small flat, and have had no issues with connectivity.",4.0,2025-02-25,United Kingdom

A little bluetooth speaker is never going to sound great but if you want a small portable speaker to take with you it does the job well.

R4HHN3FVTCN5T,"I'd already purchased a similar speaker which simply didn't work, so I wasn't overly confident about this one. Still, the reviews were positive and now it's finally up and running, I agree with them. It did take some fiddling to get it ""recognised"" by my phone and laptop, but I got there in the end! I'm not terribly keen on the rather bass-heavy sound, but then I'm a 70+ female dinosaur, so my ears are somewhat differently attuned!

The sound isn't as good as my Bose sound dock, Denon media player or old Technics system but they all cost 20x more and the difference in sound at lower volumes really isn't that much different.

Walk around the house doing chores and bring it with you, leave in next to you on the sofa and enjoy the tunes / audiobook / video sound whatever. Connected quickly, little to no latency. The red is lovely too. I'm now tempted to get another to enable the stereo capability that 2 units would have.

R2Q1K7PD4HFF35,"I recently upgraded to the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD (Newest Gen), and I’m thrilled with how it’s transformed my TV-watching experience! The setup was incredibly simple—just plug it into the HDMI port, connect to Wi-Fi, and you're good to go. The performance is smooth, and the HD streaming quality is excellent, offering crisp, clear visuals for everything from movies to TV shows.One of the standout features is the Alexa Voice Remote. I love being able to search for content, control volume, and even manage smart home devices with just my voice. Whether I’m asking Alexa to play my favorite show or dim the lights for a movie night, it’s incredibly convenient. The voice commands work seamlessly, making navigation a breeze.The free and live TV options are a great bonus, especially if you’re looking to cut the cable cord. I’ve been enjoying access to a wide range of channels and streaming services without having to switch between different apps. The Fire TV Stick HD also integrates with popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and many others, so there’s no shortage of entertainment.Another great feature is the ability to control smart home devices directly from the TV. If you have compatible smart gadgets like lights or thermostats, you can easily control them with your remote or Alexa voice commands, making it a fantastic addition to any smart home setup.Overall, the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is an excellent, affordable streaming solution that delivers a seamless experience with a wide array of features. Whether you’re new to streaming or a seasoned pro, it’s a must-have for enhancing your entertainment setup!",5.0,2025-02-17,United Kingdom 
RO7S190M0ZIBT,"I bought this to revive an old 40"" smart TV on which some apps just would not install and those that would ran so slow that I tended to avoid using it. The Firestick has completely rejuvenated it. There were also a few nice surprises, for example;- Once set up, the Firestick remote controller completely replaces the TV remote if you want to use only Firestick features. I've taken the ugly aerial off my roof and gone over to streaming only. I can still watch live TV via Firestick if I want to.- You can take the firestick with you when you travel and it works just the same on any compatible TV ( I haven't tried this yet).- The voice activated search works really well and it is fast. You can connect a Bluetooth keyboard if you prefer not talking to tech.Set up was painless and I find the interface easy to use and very quick to respond. On the negative side, the Silk browser is a little clunky to navigate via the remote but again, the voice input option really speeds things up.  You can also connect a Bluetooth mouse to make it even easier.",5.0,2025-03-15,United Kingdom

R3EGFHSJEHH3BT,"I bought this as a replacement, and I’m very impressed! The Fire TV Stick HD is incredibly easy to set up and offers excellent reception—there’s no need for an outdoor aerial, which makes it ideal for a bedroom TV.This updated version comes with a significant improvement: the remote now has built-in TV controls, including volume and power, so you don’t need to juggle multiple remotes. While it doesn’t feel quite as premium as the remote with the 4K model, it’s still a great addition and works perfectly well.In terms of performance, it streams HD content smoothly, and the interface is identical to other Fire TV devices. That said, there are a couple of compromises. It’s slightly slower than the 4K version and only supports Wi-Fi 5 instead of the newer, faster Wi-Fi 6. If you have an HD-only TV and want to save money, this is a brilliant option.However, considering the price difference is only around £5–10, I’d recommend going for the 4K model if you can. It offers better processing speeds, improved Wi-Fi, and future-proofing in case you upgrade to a 4K TV later on.Overall, the Fire TV Stick HD is great value for money and an excellent choice for simple HD streaming.

RY2EGTESQBYTX,"The parcel arrived on time, well packaged and in good order. The instructions to connect to the tv etc were found in the box, they were easy to follow, therefore I was able to connect the Firestick to the tv without any problems.  The device “found” my WiFi and connected without the need for a password.  The remote control pair with the tv, without me doing anything.  I then received a number of emails which included, “getting started”; “Exploring Apps” and “Discover what you can do with Alex on Fire TV” - all very helpful. Whilst there are only a few buttons on the remote control, they are, in my opinion, not the same symbols as normal and therefore to start with I found it a little confusing.  I have not tried the voice control as to me (elderly) it appears confusing.  In short the device was easy to fit, set up, use and it works.  The one downside I have with the system is that when you download an app ( eg iPlayer, ITV X etc); you have to “sign in”; this required me to type in my email address and password using the on screen keyboard and also the cursor- this was time consuming and I felt annoying - it would be great if this could be simplified in some way.",4.0,2025-01-05,United Kingdom

RNZJ8G1PCCSYJ,I tried the Thomson 420 box from amazon for my grand aunt. It was £50 when I bought last weekI really like the box quality and remote etc. No hdmi cable was supplied however. But a a uk 3 pin plug is standard.But frustratingly most of the UK apps had to be sideloaded. Only itvx could be installed the normal way. From what I understand this is because the TV companies review hardware products before allowing their apps to be installed on them.I used the aftv downloaded on the TV and short code links made from the techdoctoruk urls pointing to the apks.E.g. BBC iplayer code is 164237I've set things up for my grand aunt now and it's all fine. The only problem I had was I had to change the hdmi signal settings on the Thomson device to a set resolution (not auto) and switch off hdmi cec - because otherwise the signal kept confusing the TV and eventually led to a blank screen. I don't know why this happened but think it's something to do with either the TV being old or the hdmi cable I bought. It's all fine now.,4.0,2025-03-12,United Kingdom

Rather frustrating as this device runs the same Google TV Android 12+ OS as the Google Chromecast (with Google TV) streamer, even has the same CPU, GPU and RAM but for some reason the apps are just absent from the on-device app store and installing from play.google.com reveals that the apps ""are not supported on this device"".If you know the apps you want are installable (e.g. Netflix, Prime, AP TV+, Jellyfin, Plex) it seems decent but I purchased as a gift and if it doesn't have these UK centric services available then it's a non-starter.",3.0,2024-09-30,United Kingdom

R2C1Y6I46UTZ5U,"Our old Roku box was showing its age being slow and no longer getting firmware updates. So, when we upgraded our lounge TV, we also purchased this 4K Roku box.Wow, what a difference - both in terms of speed of response and picture quality! Our main APPs are NowTV, the Roku Channel, PLEX, Discovery+, Pluto, and Prime Video. All work perfectly with no issues. Picture and sound quality are stunning.To be fair, modern smart TVs have many of these APPs inbuilt. However, they often don't include the Roku Channel, Pluto and PLEX. PLEX is particularly important to us as we have a large media database on our home NAS. It also supports a lot of interesting ""live"" streaming TV channels.Set up is straightforward and it took just a few minutes to get our favourite apps sorted - and the others removed. The WiFi connection is also much faster as dual band wireless is supported on this device (HD Roku boxes only support 2.4GHz WiFi). Getting a power adapter is handy too.The remote is simple to use. It is IR rather than Bluetooth but I have had no issues - as long as the Roku box is in line of sight. Indeed, my only minor gripe is that the supplied HDMI cable is rather short to ensure this line of sight visibility for the remote control. Fortunately, I had a spare 2m HDMI 2.2 cable that works a treat!All in all, at less than £30, I am very impressed with this little device. Indeed, I am about to buy another for our bedroom TV!The whole family is rather chuffed! 😁😁😁",5.0,2024-05-28,United Kingdom 
R1BUJEDZGECOOA,"Excellent product.  Added to an older Samsung non-smart TV.  Does everything I want and more.  Large range of streaming channels including all the popular ones.  Will connect to local media streaming server - I use with Windows media server to serve foreign satellite TV recordings from a computer on the LAN.  Just need to convert them to best format for Roku - which I'd say is MKV - simple and quick with MKVToolNix which can also embed subtitles.  Means I no longer need to have a PC squatting in the living room.  Simple to use IR remote, plus the option to use an app on your mobile as a remote, so you can type and issue voice commands to Roku.  It is probably better than the options provided on many smart TVs, and for a small fraction of the price!  Be sure to get the Express 4K model, because this one can also connect to a usb stick via a simple OTG splitter Y cable, to play direct from the stick.  You can also get one of the ethernet adapters mentioned on the Roku support pages as working with the Roku Express 4K.

R1GCW4K8BCGUPU,"Amazon Prime withdrew support for our last Roku. It was still working, but the remote was a little hesitant and some streaming services were not as good as when it was first purchased. BBC iPlayer, in particular, was approaching unusable with its latest front end. Having read all the reviews I decided to purchase a replacement slightly above our immediate needs as a measure of future proofing.In preparation for the switch I collected the login details for all of the streaming channels - this is important - your Roku membership remembers who you are subscribed to, but not your logins.The mechanical aspects of switch over take minutes - and there was an immediate noticeable improvement in speed of response and picture quality. The Roku start-up tune has changed as well and is far less annoying. The entering of subscription details was still slow - but it only needs to done once unless your have to reset the device.Now for the changes: this Roku uses an optical remote rather than wireless - this means two important things: 1) the 'box' has to be sited where it can see the room 2) the remote has to be aimed at the box to operate. In respect of point 1 I found the enclosed HDMI cable was only just long enough to reach under the TV to the top of the sound bar - if you have a very large TV you may need to stick the box to the TV - there is a sticky pad enclosed for this purpose.Now for operation. It is fast - certainly massively fast in comparison to its predecessor. Picture quality is better. BBC iPlayer, which should be some official benchmark, now works smoothly and almost instantly. Now for the thing that really made a change - it supports private sound broadcast to your phone, if your phone supports the Roku app. This means you can watch action movies late at night using headphones without disturbing anyone else in the house.Overall, the purchase was a success and one which I wish I had made earlier.",5.0,2021-12-28,United Kingdom

RCMU6HOWT0LIZ,"Purchased the Roku Express 4K box to be able to continue watch the WWE which unfortunately now is only available on Netflix.My TV set has built in ""Netflix"" but sadly can't play Live Streams !!! so I ended up having to purchase the Roku Box to continue to watch the WWE (well somebodies gotta watch it).Picture quality is varied depending I suppose on quality of whatever the streaming service offers.While for the most part the video quality is good I have noticed it's not great as there's a lot of ""banding"" in many scenes on whatever you are watching, especially on the likes of backgrounds/ shadows that fade from dark to light or in skies fading from dark to light, same with underwater scenes which to me can be quite distracting and disappointing.Not a fan of ""Streaming TV"" to be honest (prefer to use my Sky box where possible) as it seems most streaming services are a bit of a lottery as to the quality of the video streams they serve.Also it's a costly pain in the bum having to purchase an expensive recoding box just to be able to record and keep things as that's one of the worst things about this ""Streaming"" nonsense is that you never know how long they are going to keep your favourite shows available before they drop them and they disappear.That being said though, I'm pretty sure it's the actual quality of output the Roku box that is the cause of all this banding as you can have the same show playing via the Roku box on your TV set and playing via a browser on your computer and there's no ""banding"" on the computers display as there is on the exact same show playing on your TV set via the Roku Box.Not a lot you can do about it unless you don't want to watch your favourite TV shows anymore such as the WWE which is now only on ""Netflix"".Seems odd though that with all this tech we have today that many people put up with these poorer/ lower quality ""Streaming services"" which have basically taken over from actual broadcast TV feeds and those behind these streaming services know they can get away with supplying lower quality footage as basically there is increasingly less and less options to be able to watch high quality broadcast footage via terrestrial means... so much for progress eh !!!",4.0,2025-02-23,United Kingdom

R3FSPHNYLWI3IZ,"This devise is easy to set up and operate, it responds quickly with no buffering seen, so in this respect it’s better than the Firestick. However, definition isn’t as good, to my eyes the Firestick produces a noticeably crisper, more detailed picture. A reservation I had was over the remote control being infrared as opposed to wireless. Unlike a wireless signal, which travels through solid objects, an IR receiver has to be able to see the infrared beam from the remote control, rather like the beam of light from a torch. I didn’t want more wires and clutter, so tried securing the receiver to the back of the TV near the top edge, where it’s hidden from view and it works perfectly (see photo).

R3OZQEGNXI7MH6,"After my Virgin Tivo box discontinued Netflix Basic Plan support I was forced to investigate streaming devices. I'm glad I did as the Roku experience is so much better.I was particularly keen to use a wired ethernet connection which is harder to achieve than you would think as most devices (Roku or Firestick) don't have the necessary ethernet port (the Roku Ultra not officially being available in the UK). But I'm pleased to confirm the Roku Express 4K (the + seems to be dropped now on the latest models) works with an adapter (I'm using the Ugreen Micro USB 100 mbps adapter).Everything was easy to set up through the remote control and through registering your Roku account on their website via your email. The wired connection was found immediately (note that this adapter provides 3 connections - to the Roku Express, to your internet modem or switch, and to your mains power which now connects through the adapter not the Roku  - none of this was obvious doing my research before buying where there is much conflicting advice, even from the manufacturers themselves - see picture). The only additional item you need is a RJ45 cable.Netflix basic works fine and there's loads of interesting looking free channels you can download via the remote or the online account. Some like Youtube you have to search for but it is there. You can also remove apps if you aren't going to use them or pay for them (including the bbc iplayer).",5.0,2024-07-16,United Kingdom

Two Roku streaming boxes cost me 58 pounds in a sale and I am very happy with how tiny and discrete the box is and easy to hide by using the enclosed sticker and sticking up on bottom of tv. Much better position than a stick dragging down on the back of the tv. The choice of free channels and programs is very good as well. Can still access our Amazon Prime viewing via the app on the home screen as well as our Disney subscription. All main streaming apps on the main page software as well.

R3RRMGH8S9EVGJ,"I have only had it for a few days so I have only just scratched the surface of what it can do. The first time I tried the BBC iPlayer app I was impressed by how smooth and fast it worked compared with the same app built into my old Panasonic TV and my TalkTalk YouView box. I can finally seek forward and back with confidence. The Roku is certainly a cheap way to upgrade an old TV that is otherwise still working fine. Apple AirPlay and Android casting also work well.Now comes the not-so-good points:To activate the device you need to provide a payment method. This is a source of irritation even though the payment method can be removed from the account afterwards.The accompanying smartphone app has a keyboard feature that is supposed to give you an easy way to enter text. It did not work when I tried to use it to log into apps such as All4.The search feature is supposed to search for content across the myriad of apps that the device supports. Unfortunately, the results are incomplete. For example, at the time of writing, Battlestar Galactica and Pretty Little Liars are available for free viewing on the BBC iPlayer, Nashville is on ALL4, yet a Roku search for these programmes only shows options that require subscription or payment. This has immediately made the optional Roku Voice Remote so much less appealing.The Roku Media Player is the app that plays videos from a DLNA server. While it handles mp4 content reasonably well, all transport controls fail when playing ts files (ts is the typically format for videos that are recorded from over-the-air broadcasts).",4.0,2022-12-03,United Kingdom

It has better picture quality, much snappier menu response and unlike the Roku 3 works perfectly with the Emby app / channel - the Roku 3 had strange Emby issues where everything would play at double speed.Although Roku don't exactly make this clear (the info is buried deep within their UK online support pages and mentioned nowhere in the printed documentation) it will also work with at least some external Ethernet adaptors. However of the three ""supported"" adaptors listed by Roku, two are no longer available and the Ugreen one (the only brand I recognized) carries a stern warning on their Amazon listing that it DOES NOT work with the Roku Express 4K.

R3OSQD0AZYZ7DE,"Roku Express is the type of device that you install forget about but when you remember - it is well worth it.Let's be honest there are a lot of junk channels, quirky channels and some excellent ""must-see"" channels. Which are which? Well, my junk may be your essential and vice versa but there is so much - on-demand, premium subscription, sports, religious, entertainment... basically, you name it, it is probably somewhere on Roku.This is my third Roku device: original set-top; USB and now this HDMI 4K version and I have watched it move from ok to excellent. The selling-point on this one is that it is 4K - and great 4K at that. It will check your equipment and stream at the highest quality manageable so that means get a good quality HDMI cable that can handle a 4K stream. It is a bit quirky, it may display a menu at 720p but goes to 1080p when you start streaming. On the right channel a black screen flashes and suddenly it is broadcasting in 4K with 5.1 surround sound and you are in your own cinema.The Roku menu is fairly intuitive and customisable. It is worth spending some time looking through the channels and putting them on your home screen, reorganising the order to suit your preferences and, off you go. The menu is a little bit clunky but, honestly, who cares? It's all about the content, baby.It is currently discounted and so the price is good. It comes with all cables and a cute little remote that can be lost down the sofa in an instant.If you are thinking about buying a streaming device stop thinking and click 'buy now' - definitely worth it.",5.0,2022-02-11,United Kingdom

Took a chance on the Roku as my telly at the time while being ""smart"" wasn't actually all that clever  so using anything other than youtube or netflix on it wasn't happening.Long story short, I got COVID earlier on in the year and was laid up for nearly a fortnight with it. So rather than lug my xbox downstairs to my comfy settee fort and back upstairs when it was time for bo-bose, I used the bog standard Fire Stick I had. That thing for a lack of better words was the most slowest, awkwardest ballache I've ever had the displeasure of using. So I took a chance on the Roku. Best idea ever purchasing this thing. Set up was an absolute breeze, it doesn't have the excruciating lag and slowness of some of the older Fire Sticks and while certain areas of the UI aren't the best (the only con I can think of right now,) operation is relatively simple and easy.I love this little piece of kit so much, I'm buying another for my bedroom telly upstairs so I don't have to deal with my rather vocal xbox making a racket and having to switch on the controller every two minutes to pause or whatever.

Not enough to make me return but this is the last Roku device I buy.If you have never had a Roku before be warned that it forces you to set up an account and during that process it forces you to give payment card details.  There is no way to skip.  According to some posts on their forums there is a hidden skip button that if you know about website coding you can go into and find but the mods constantly remove the posts explaining how to do this.  I do not know if this is true or not.  I luckily had an old Roku account with no payment information saved so could get it working.I was planning to buy a Roku for my parents and sister but now I can't create accounts for them without their payment information I'm looking at other devices.  I am amazed it is legal to force the payment information when you are not making a purchase and you paid for the device.The IR remote feels a bit cheap compared to the old one I'm used to.  I'm also used to not having an IR remote that just worked no matter where it was pointed and the device could be hidden behind the TV.  Now I'm constantly having to wave my arm around to aim at an ugly thing sticking out beside my TV.No ethernet connection on the device is annoying.  You can buy a dongle to add a network port for a cable but it just makes everything more complicated with more cables to try and hide.Bought my first Roku device around 8 years ago and used to sing their praises.  Have a couple of friends that bought them because of my advice.  Shame to see that they appear to be looking to gouge you for as much money as possible now - how the world seems to be going.  Due to the external slightly 'cheap' feel to the device and cheap account tactics I assume the internals are as cheap as possible too meaning this will not last as long as my older device that was solid as a brick and worked for years.,2.0,2023-08-29,United Kingdom

Pay up here for for what should be a free channel. It started frustrating anf continues frustrating. At the start I spent several frustrating hours to get this to work. Problem was it was totally US-centric with hundreds of totally irelevent and mostly awful US channels. No BBC iplayer ITVx etc. Only BBC was BBC America. Asked for location and only option was US zipcode. Roku help totally useless. Just about to pack up but gave one last try. I found online (not Roku) suggestion to delete account. I also used reset button on unit. Hey presto unit finally got rid of US. settings and later in set up asked for 1st part of POSTCODE. From then on things FINALLY got better with BBC ITV Ch 4 etc. Why in the world Roku sent out units for UK sale set up for the US beggars belief and NO instructions whatsover to rectify it It reflects their indifferent customer support.MY ADVICE. On receipt,  power the unit up then IMMEDIATLY press the reset button on the unit to get rid of US settings. Once connected to wifi It should then download and reset to UK settings. I note several people have had same problems.I hope this helps save other people the time I have wasted and get started quicker. All down to abysmal sloppiness on Rokus part in sending out units setup for US and giving NO instructions in set up procedure to correct this.in use some great feature and some incredibly stupid parts. Found a film great. Supposed to be free BUT click that and you get a list of Spanish language stations with a list of impenetrable options and film is impossible to find. Only easy option is to cough up for rental. Back to good old DVD rather than use this crafty underhand method to pay up.News live stream channels. Roku give impression they are free but no many such as Fox news amd others are subscription only You could end to paying hundreds of pounds a year if you aren not careful. There are some free channels but I get the impression Roku is more about being a marketing device to get you to sign up to subcription channels. Oh another things. UK channels. You CANNOT local news channels on BBC and ITV. Screen goes blank. I am finding I can do fewer and fewer things that I expected. I need to get my Freeview aerial and box sorted. Had hoped Roku would enable me to replace Freeview but dashed hopes. Bought remote that is supposed to connect to my TV. Although brand comes up it refuses to connect. Voice control...wont work. Absolute faffing about trying to get it set up. Their instructions DONT work. The whole thing has limited usefulness but its main purpose seems to be to trap you into signing up for paid for channels. Review now downgrading to 1 star. Just wish there was. better alternative.

Takes about 5 minutes (tops).My only disappointment is that the audio has an issue on the majority of apps. I run my audio through a soundbar which has Dolby Digital which the Express should output. I have only managed to run this through the Apple and Roku apps. I messaged Disney and Now as part of my investigation and they confirmed they have got issues (I assuming licensing) that restricts them playing the audio correctly.

R189REJBYPAC1E,"Good:- Powers off USB, so if your TV has a USB port, it can use that and power on when you power on the TV- Small and neat (it's about the size of a gherkin).- Comes with a sticky pad so you can position it once and it will stay in position.Bad:- Framerate can sometimes drop if there is too much going on on the screen.- Lacks some of the features of older Rokus (wired connection, radio remote)I bought this to replace an older Roku 3 which had become prone to overheating. It's currently attached to an old TV in our bedroom, and for that it works fine. It connects to your network via wireless only, and because it takes power from a USB port the wiring you need is minimal.The streaming quality is not great when compared to my LG smart TV.For example, if we have a scene where we are flying over a landscape in a Netflix drama, my LG TV will cope fine with that, and not drop frames.  The same scene played through the Roku device looks quite different. The framerate drops and the overall effect becomes quite jerky.  I saw several examples of this where the framerate and resolution started to drop if there was too much movement on the screen at once.Overall, I think it's a reasonable buy, if you can accept the limitations. As a way of adding streaming capability to an old TV it works fine.

The voice control with Alexa is a game-changer. I can just tell it what I want to watch or ask it to do stuff around the house without lifting a finger.The picture quality is top-notch. Streaming in 4K looks amazing, and everything loads quickly. Switching between apps and shows is smooth, and the voice commands make it all so much easier.Plus, the Fire Cube has a built-in speaker that’s actually pretty handy. It’s great for quick voice commands or some background music without needing extra gear.Design-wise, it’s sleek and fits right in with my other tech. The remote is easy to use and feels solid.Overall, the Fire Cube is a solid upgrade. If you’re into streaming and want something that makes life a bit easier, definitely give it a try!",5.0,2024-09-08,United Kingdom 
R1KRBHIN3VOJR3,"My Home Cinema System consists of a BenQ 4K HDR UST Projector, the Amazon 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube (Since Nov 2019) and a Denon 4K HDR Receiver. I turn all my Home Cinema Equipment ON & OFF using a Backlit-LCD Logitech Elite Remote / Hub setup.Despite my previously submitted, lengthy Amazon Post on why I am staying with my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube (now removed), I just couldn’t resist upgrading to Amazon’s Latest 3rd Gen Cube.As usual, the Device was delivered the next day, well Packaged, with a nice Finish & Build Quality of the Cube, Remote (not used) and Power Supply.It may be worth mentioning that when I recently added a Nvidia Shield TV Pro Streaming device to my Home Cinema System, I was informed by one of my Subscription Services, that I had reached my Licence Limit. Mindful of this and just to be on the safe side, I De-Registered my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube, having first signed out of all my Subscription Services, prior to setting  my new 3rd Gen Cube.Pairing my Alexa Remote PRO (purchased separately), was straight forward as was signing into my Amazon Prime Account. As previously stated, I use a Logitech Remote to turn all my Home Cinema Equipment ON & OFF. This is because most Remotes, including Amazon Remotes cannot be setup to turn my Projector OFF. My Projector has a quirky feature that requires the OFF button to be pressed twice before it turns OFF (even with its Original Remote). My Logitech Elite Remote allows me to program the 4K Projector, as a Device, with 2 OFF Commands, having a 1 second delay between each which works fine. My Logotech Remote is paired with the Fire TV Cube allowing full control of the Cube. However, once started, I prefer to use the more conveniently sized Backlit Alexa TV Remote PRO whilst viewing the Fire TV Cube Streaming Services.Obviously, I want the Amazon Remote to control my Denon's Volume / Mute, but the Cubes setup process requires that a TV is selected before you can add a Soundbar / Receiver Equipment. Generally, TVs are straight forward to setup with the Fire TV Cube but the same cannot be said for my Projector. The process involves the Cube turning the Connected TV OFF then ON again. Following the onscreen instructions, for Projectors, you need to press the Amazon Remotes Menu Key. Then you are confronted with a selection of IR Codes to switch the Projector OFF and then ON again. Obviously, as already stated, no single IR code would ever work for the OFF Command. Personally, I’m not keen on the idea of quickly turning a Laser Projector OFF-ON again, before the Lamp has had time to cool down. I decided to Select BenQ as a TV and told Alexa that this TV did turn OFF and ON again, which was not true. Now I was given the option to add a Soundbar / Receiver to my Cubes Equipment list. Setting up Alexa Remote PRO Volume / Mute buttons to work with my 4K Denon Receiver was straight forward. Having Logged back into all my Subscription Services, I completed the setup process by programming Buttons 1 & 2 on the Alexa Remote PRO, allowing instant access of 2 Apps (ITVX & Freevee) not visible on the Amazon Prime Start-Up Screen Banner.All in all, I am very pleased that I have Upgraded my Home Cinema System with the latest 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube from Amazon. The truth is, I cannot really detect any significant Performance improvement over my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube, but everything is Fast, Smooth and Responsive. Two of the additional features that this 3rd Gen Cube includes are Wi-Fi 6E and the HDMI 2.1 Input. Upgrading to a Wi-Fi 6E Network seems to be quite an expensive undertaking, whilst I currently have no interest using the Cubes HDMI Input for other devices. I believe the Image Quality of the 3rd Gen Cube looks better than its predecessor. I did notice, whilst drilling down the various 3rd Gen Cube Menus, under Display & Audio / Display that the last option allows you to turn, “Super Resolution” ON or OFF, which when turned ON produces a Sharper Picture. This may explain my perceived Image Quality Enhancement over this Cubes predecessor.My 2nd Gen TV Cube sounded very tinny and unpleasant. To get around this, I redirected the 2nd Gen Cubes audio output to my 3rd Gen Echo Dot (Fabric version), the sound quality being very much on par with the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube. Having upgraded to the 3rd Gen Fire Tv Cube, I no longer need the 3rd Gen Echo Dot, meaning one less power socket is being used.To Summarise, the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube is a Superior Device over its predecessor, including a couple of additional, worthwhile features, which I may come to appreciate sometime in the future. This Fire TV Cube’s Processors have also been upgraded from a Hexi-Core to an Octa-Core, offering a higher level of technical performance than its predecessor.These days Voice Control of Hi-Fi & Domestic equipment is a feature that really does need to be included, with Streaming Devices, to remain competitive. I find the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube's Voice Control, every bit as capable as its 2nd Gen predecessor. I have a couple of Smart Sockets to operate Audio equipment using Alexa Voice Control and most of the rooms in my home use Alexa Voice Control to switch Lighting On-Off. Although the initial novelty factor has worn off somewhat, Voice Control is a still a cool feature. Alexa Voice Control through the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube, does work well, but being Old-School, I prefer to use the Alexa Remote Pro / Logitech Elite for my Home Cinema Device Control / Navigation.I am pleased that I have upgraded to the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube which I purchased at an Amazon reduction of £20 on the normal selling price. This effectively reduced the  price of the Alexa Remote PRO which I had purchased previously for use with my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cube.I would Recommend the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen, with a Big-Thumbs-Up, hence this 5 Star Review.  ***** REVIEW UPDATE – 7th June 2023 ****At this moment in time, my BenQ 4K Projector is being repaired, so I’m using my old LG 55” 4K OLED TV (with Screen-Burn). The BIG plus is, because I’m not using the BenQ Projector (2 OFF Commands), I can use the Amazon Remote Pro to Switch my LG TV, Fire TV Cube & Denon Receiver ON & OFF. This means I do not need to use my Logitech Elite Remote at all.Another change I have made, which I initially shunned, is to connect my Nvidia Shield TV Pro into the Fire TV Cubes HDMI 2.1 Input. This has freed up one Denon 4K HDMI Input, allowing me to quickly switch between the Amazon Cube and the Nvidia Shield. This makes Audio-Visual Comparison between the two Devices much Easier and Effective than having to change Denon Inputs to select each of the Streaming Devices. So, the 3rd Gen Fire TV Cube’s HDMI 2.1 Input is a very worthwhile addition.My Home Cinema preference is to turn each required Hi-Fi Device On-Off without using HDMI CEC Auto-Sensing. This, I believe, made the detection of the Nvidia Shield’s HDMI Signal via the Fire TV Cubes HDMI Input, somewhat more challenging than expected but with perseverance was achieved.Nvidia Shield TV Pro Amendment 21.09.2023Since connecting my Shield TV Pro to the Fire TV Cubes 2.1 HDMI Input, I have been experiencing regular 1 second Audio Drop-Outs. It would seem that this Audio Drop-Out issue has been flagged many times since 2019 by Shield TV Pro owners. I think this may have something to do with HDMI Pass-Through compatibility. As I’m fully conversant with the Pros & Cons of the Cube and the Shield Streaming Devices, I no longer require the previously mentioned, efficient Audio-Visual comparison switching. My Shield TV Pro is now connected to its own dedicated Denon HDMI Input, whilst I now use the Fire TV Cubes HDMI 2.1 Input, with my FreeviewPlay SD/HD Player/Recorder. This has sorted the Shields Audio Drop-Outs, whilst Switching between the Cube and the TV Set-Top Box makes far more sense and is a more convenient setup.",5.0,2023-04-08,United Kingdom 
R5DJVQ7VHP98O,"Please see my photosThis is a most wonderful piece of kit, not realising just how much more responsive it is than the 4K Max TV Fire Stick, but it is. Using some of the apps like iPlayer, ITVx, Channel 4 apps etc....All very fast at loading and navigating. Great improvements there.The Octa Core processor seems to be much faster than the previous Hex Core one they had used.This is not the first Cube we have had, but it has been a very decent improvement over the older model.We very much like its Alexa integration possibilities as well as the remote having buttons for Netflix and Prime instant launch options. The Alexa integration goes as far as using voice controls to switch on and off smart sockets attached to lighting that is controlled via Alexa in our home. It will do that.Voice command support is interesting and we are beginning to appreciate that. Playing the radio etc.....all that is meant we have now freed up an Alex device in the room the Cube is in to use elsewhere, great value.Note you can't ask the Cube to play music from its internal speaker, it is not an Echo device. The TV would need to be on for it to play music and the audio for that is sent via the HDMI lead.That is why we have connected our Cube by BT to a Sony standalone speaker, to be used when needed for playing music without the TV needing to be on.The super resolution scaling is as good as what our TV could do, meaning it is very good. When running SD content, or 1080p, upscaling using the Cube looks incredibly sharp, not overly, and detail is vey much retained and, seemingly, even improved.Super Resolution set under Settings and the Display and Audio, just scroll down and enable.Setting it up was very very easy, it came linked to my account, option at purchase, and even allowed us, see photo, to synchronise the visual picture animation of a bouncing ball with the sound. That ensures both are synchronised.As noted the responsiveness of this box is faster than the Max 4K stick, whilst enjoying the integrated speaker, HDMI in, Full sized USB A and, this part not entirely useful, built in Ethernet.That leads me to the reason why I dropped a star from the review.This is the third generation Cube and it is using a 100Mb Ethernet connection. That can be problematic if being used for Plex or Emby AND you are streaming very large 4k material at very high bit rates.We have Wi-Fi 6 and we then tried going from the rather slow Ethernet connection to Wi-Fi, the router being close to where the Cube is. It is decent, well better than the Ethernet for our needs, BUT our Wi-Fi is not used just for the Cube and we have that many other devices, including Wireless VR, that the bandwidth can be limited.See applicable photo for the next part.We had a Ugreen 1GB Ethernet adapter to use, that connects to the Cube via the USB A port on it. That allows a much faster Ethernet connection than the 100Mb, but still seems to be limited by the USB port to around 350Mb. Still, faster than the Ethernet port on the Cube.For our needs that is perfect.I can also connect, low powered, devices to the adapter by its 3 onboard USB ports, in our case a Wireless adapter for our Logitech keyboard.So, overall, the DV and HDR support that this Cube offers works a treat. Sound wise, nothing exotic for us, as long as it supports DD and DTS, and that works fine also, then we are happy enough. That is passed through the HDMI lead. It has never failed to pick up the correct HDR / DV content correctly, nor the appropriate audio stream.Storage wise seems ok, if you did not need to use the USB port as I did then you could have additional storage there, with the option to move apps to it that would help to supplement the onboard storage.An excellent piece of kit, very much improved from their previous generation and what is offered works well. Whilst there have been work around for the rather pedestrian 100Mbs LAN options there should have been a 1Gbs connection fitted to this device.Recognising that the Cube is NOT and Echo device be prepared to understand its limitations on playing music etc, a described above.Perhaps the Ethernet and sound limitations could be improved on for newer generations of this device.Very much recommended and very much enjoyed.Hope this review has been helpful.",4.0,2024-10-06,United Kingdom

R1DCIVH35TGYAW,"OK, so you do need a good wifi connection or, as mine, plugged in via ethernet via TP link powerline adaptors. (ethernet always better than wi-fi). Once this is sorted it works a treat. I've upgraded from an old (very old) Amazon fire TV box, so this is lightning fast compared to that! Worth looking on YouTube for tips and tricks to keep it running smoothly. For example you can 'force stop' apps on the box once you've finished watching. This is importand because all apps will stay running in the background (like mobile phone) unless you stop them. Over time this can build and interfere with performance. It is woth the money over the firestick as I feel it will be slightly more 'futureproof' and love the ethernet connection should you wish to use it. Very happy with this. Had been in two minds which to get: fire stick or this. Really glad I got this. Smaller than you think as well, so sits very neatly on shelf near TV.",5.0,2024-03-05,United Kingdom 
R19ERDXD39RDLU,"Having used a Fire Cube Gen 2 for a long time and loving it, I was expecting more of the same from the new version but oh boy was I wrong!With the old Gen 2 starting to slow down and recently upgrading to a new TV, I was excited to see the improvements in Gen 3. Out of the box, everything seemed great, easy to get up and running in a couple of minutes and all linked to my account already. Living in the future felt good.This is where things go downhill...severely. Day 2 of the new fire cube and I started having sync issues. I tried the audio fix recommended by Amazon which helped but did not completely solve my issue. I'm still having some slight sync issues I searched forums to find this is a very common issue with Gen 3. The good news this means there are lots of guides for each model of TV to fix the issue and eventually I got everything in sync, but a lot of faff and searching forums to get there and amazon support pretty lackluster.If this is where my issues ended this would still be a 5-star review for me. But it was just the beginning. I started to notice Alexa is a little different in Gen 3. The good bit is it recognises my voice better but that is the only good. Alexa seems much dumber in Gen 3, ask a general question whilst in the YouTube app and all Alexa will do is search YouTube for what you are asking. Ask Alexa to stop music playing in the background and it will tell you it doesn't understand what you mean. It has also started being triggered by audio coming from the TV and searching for random sentences when anything remotely close to ""Alexa"" is mentioned.I also have an issue with the way the pass-through HDMI works, why on earth you would make it have to show the timer on screen when using the pass-through for playing Xbox or something is baffling, sort of defeats the point of using the pass-through in my opinion.There are many other little niggles I have with Gen 3 and honestly wish I had found a way to restore my Gen 2 to its former glory.Make Alexa smart again please.",1.0,2024-02-11,United Kingdom

R2BRXDUMALWRMG,"Warning: Speaker cannot be used to play media and doesn't even work for Alexa if you're plugged into a TV that is turned on!I have a monitor with no TV Tuner or built in Speakers which I use for my media, so I was using a Firestick, an Alexa and Bluetooth speaker, so when I saw the Cube I thought ""great, that can do all three for me"", but alas, it can only do two it seems. I was surprised I had no sound when I plugged in the HDMI cable so pulled it out and then the Cube's speaker worked. I Googled and kept finding stuff about an ""Audio Output"" setting which I couldn't find either in the Cube's settings.The Cube's built-in speaker has the absolute minimal functionality? It's a just a substitute for an external speaker when one isn't plugged in. That is pretty poor I must say, especially as my Echo Dot's speaker is decent quality so was hoping this would be even better.Amazon, if you do a Gen 4, make the internal speaker better and make it so it can be used as a standalone speaker for Alexa AND any media being played through it regardless of whether it is plugged into another source or not!  Simply add a setting so users can choose to use their TV Speakers/Bluetooth or the Cube's own speakersI can play media through my Echo Dot from my Firestick via Bluetooth, but I can't play media through the speaker of the Cube from its own inbuilt Fire TV app...yet this device is marketed as one that can replace both.",3.0,2025-01-21,United Kingdom

R2P70S9B7MZB9N,"I recently purchased two Amazon echo 4th generation devices and I though what better way to get into the Amazon echo system than trying out the fire TV cube. As of this time of writing I purchased for £109.99 on sale due to prime sales. It was a very simplistic set up and has a very simplistic user interface meaning that you can download apps from the app store with ease, the sound quality especially when connecting two echo 4th generation devices has punchy bass and is great for listening to music to gaming and even watching good ol' Amazon prime, Netflix and Disney Plus.The best thing however is that if you plug the Amazon fire cube TV into an HDMI arc/earc  port and turn on HDMI CEC or In my case if your an LG TV User Simplink on your TV and have either a playstation 5 or Xbox series console connected you can then use your Alexa home theater to pass through audio of your gaming console to the two echo devices. I will admit though it was abit glitchy at first but after a quick restart of the fire cube TV it soon sorted it self out and I haven't had problems since.The quality of the fire cube comes packaged as far as I can remember in Amazon branded recycled paper. My only complaint is that it does not come bundled with a hdmi cable so my advice would be to buy a hdmi cable off Amazon wheather being Anker or UGREEN or even Amazon themselves.The size of the cube is very tiny. I would same even smaller than the Apple TV.The functionality of the device is very user friendly and also supports Dolby vision and if you have a compatible TV or a echo studio will even work with Dolby AtmosMy only complaint is that I wish there was more storage on the terms of the recently released Google TV Streamer which has 32GB and even the baseline apple TV starts at 64GBThe Amazon fire cube only has 16GB of storage but however have seen online that you can increase the baseline storage somehowHowever it was a great purchase and I can't wait till I get my echo subwoofer eventually to go with it.",5.0,2024-10-07,United Kingdom 
R1Q9BQPRR4H2US,"There is so much that is great about the all new Cube and with continuing regular updates it is one of the best streaming devices on the market... it's lightning fast with a USB interface and Ethernet, although it is disappointing that these connections are somewhat outdated. Ethernet is only 10/100 so it could be a struggle to stream your own content from a home server (Plex, Emby, Kodi etc.) without transcoding the video/audio. However, the WiFi 6 implementation is a welcome addition and bypasses the problem, assuming you have the Network capability so it's something to bear in mind when buying. I think my advice to amazon going forward would be anyone paying £140 for the device would have probably paid £160 for Gigabit ethernet and Superspeed USB.The new look is great, and it's now uniform with the rest of the Echo range (No more fingerprints to clean!!)Prime Video has seen lots of updates, I'm now experiencing excellent streaming quality with the correct resolutions and adaptive HDR setting activating with the correct refresh rates and audio bitstreams. I've seen a few negative postings about the super resolution upscaling. However, when I play a native 1080p and the screen resolution of the content video matches the native video display resolution - the upscaling really kicks in and works brilliantly!!All apps I have tried are now bit-streaming Dolby signals at DD+/Atmos, but under the guise of pcm/multi dds. A very welcome recent update has allowed True HD signals to be encoded and I'm getting Dolby signals and DTS X Bit-streamed from these audio codecs. I'm hearing a clarity of sound I've not experienced on a Fire device before and it will suit most cinephiles with half decent AV/Soundbar setups!! Tip for anyone wanting to pass through... Be aware that the cube is quite capable of processing all the codecs while keeping the voice assistant audible and features when watching on plex/vlc/kodi. You're going to see PCM-multi on your display but from my most recent experience and testing it's because the cube takes it all in and outputs it at a raw (pcm multi level) format to be able to cooperate with the alexa voice responses but I've noticed no difference when passing through directly except alexa responses won't happen when doing it this way.... brilliance from the amazon team and more people need to be aware of its function.The Cube Prime music is pretty decent although casting from the mobile app will play through an Alexa screen card as opposed to the native music app, which makes sense since different devices will have different audio capabilities in a group speaker setting... Although if I send music to the group where my TV cube is from somewhere else it plays through the the music app and all becomes a little confusing and disparate at times.It’s worth noting that there has been some customer pushback about the new way music selection/playback for prime subscribers now works with certain caveats on listening choice so research this if buying.It’s not personally an issue as I have always subscribed to prime music in addition, and may I say it's worth every penny if you have an Atmos/Spatial audio setup as more and more tracks are being added in these formats). I'm experiencing 24/192 playback Ultra HD when available in the music app and atmos/3d tracks sound amazing.It would be nice if I could add a song to my playlist via voice in the amazon music app... but apparently no music is playing when attempting the command... even a button selection to add the current song to playlist would be helpful in the app.On that note, the ability to play Amazon music from the mobile phone app to devices/multiroom music groups can now can be minimised for background play... so you can still browse other content of some apps without it stopping playback and is a welcomed feature. When using this playback mode, you can also add songs to playlist via voice command. It also behaves this way for multi-room music which is great if someone is also listening somewhere in the house while you're browsing around content, although again some apps do take control of the system audio on launch which will cut the music off (such as BBC Iplayer, ITVX, and Channel 4 Apps..... however, browsing home screen content, prime video, YouTube and silk web browsing is fine).Hopefully, Amazon is aware of this and going forward they could request app publishers not to take audio control on app launch, but rather on selecting an item for playback within their app.The HDMI IN for a set-top cable/satellite TV box or other HDMI Device is brilliant. I have a PC going through and is comfortably handling 4K resolutions @ 60HZ - it's an amazing feature that really makes it stand out from other devices and Alexa overlays for info cards/cameras is such a great feature. I only wish it had perhaps even an extra one or two HDMI In ports, but who's to say Amazon couldn't introduce their own HDMI switcher to add additional ports, maybe? Since the device is compatible with Hdmi 2.1 it would also be great to see 120hz vrr handled in the future of the device.On balance, I really recommend this product, especially if you have an existing Alexa ecosystem in your smart home. It is regularly maintained and updated by the Fire TV team, who have listened to feedback and responded with some great work and it has really gone from strength to strength - so well done guys! Would be nice to see the fire TV ambient screen option come to this device since the new 2023 fire TV 4k stick will be getting it, I'm sure this device is capable.

R3T8T5VMUGPGMK,"I bought this for the ability to create a “home theatre” out of 2 Echo Studios. I was already happy with the smart tv features on my LG tv.Firstly as a smart steamer I would rate it as “fine”. It has all the major apps you’d want and it’s fast enough to do the job. There is more of a focus on tv and movies than the apps, so the homepage being full of Amazon prime video content necessarily requires you to have a prime subscription to enjoy/want that setup. If I were wanting to add the ability to watch tv and movies on a pc monitor, the cube would be good option as it adds the “smart tv” and also it does 4k up scaling which a good tv would already do, but a monitor wouldn’t.When I setup the home cinema I made the mistake of connecting the fire cube via ethernet. This made the connection between the studios and the cube mostly not work after the initial setup. It seems that the cube and the studios are communicating directly on your network and not via the internet. So when I had the cube on the lan (wired network) and the studios on the wan (wireless network) there seems to be a lot of communication issues and general not working. When I put the cube on the wireless network it has been fine since. I would also suggest removing the cubes “Alexa priority” in the cube settings and in the settings for the room on Alexa app to select “home cinema” as default for the room it’s in. This meant that if I say play … it just responds like a normal echo device would (albeit with the stereo pair). I have mostly tried the setup with the TV’s apps and just outputting the sound via eARC to the cube (and hence studio pair), I did need to change the TVs output to pass through rather than pcm.Now in terms sound the pair of studios is decent. With a total hardware cost £500 or so, it’s well worth that money. The studios produce a good wall of sound coming from the front. There are no convincing surround effects or centre. The sound is very balanced, with lows, highs and mids all being delivered well. I think the additional sub would probably be too much and disturb what is a pleasant balance. Overall I would say it was a game changing upgrade from TV speakers and a really good value minimalist setup. I think you’d need a system with dedicated rear speakers to justify getting a soundbar or similar system over this.",3.0,2024-04-10,United Kingdom

R2NYZPZ7ZOUL71,"December 2022 update: A customer service rep from Amazon called me having seen my review. We tried on the phone to sort the Virgin Media issue out. We came to the conclusion that the Cube can switch HDMI to Virgin via Alexa- but ONLY if the HDMI cable from the Virgin Media box is connected to the TV directly. However, with the HDMI cable from the Virgin Box in to the Cube, Alexa does not know how to switch to Virgin. You have to manually scroll across to the Input setting and a preview of Virgin TV comes up before you select it. The Customer service rep has assured me that the issue will be passed on to their technical team. So hopefully there is an update in regards to this. Other than this- the Cube has been working brilliantly.As this was reduced to £119 on the Black Friday deal, I upgraded from the 4K Max Fire Stick. Having said that I sold my 4K Max Firestick for £21 and a Google Chromecast 4K for £20 (which Google sold for £10 to me). So essentially, I guess I only paid £78. I doubt I would pay £119 for this let alone £139!It is undoubtedly faster and smoother. The difference in terms of speed from the 4K Max is probably a couple of seconds. If saving a couple of seconds loading/scrolling time improves your life in anyway, then yeah- go for it!However, is it worth upgrading from the 4K Max Fire Stick? I would say no. So why did I? This is where I am 'sitting on the fence' (at present)The product description says that the Fire TV Cube is compatible with Virgin Media. I think this is a half baked truth. When you want to set up cable or satellite, the only options at first are Sky. You cannot select Virgin Media. It is only when you go in to the Add Equipment setting on the Cube that a whole list of other providers show up including Virgin Media. You can then set it so you can change to Virgin Media via the home screen HDMI option but not via Alexa. You also cannot change the Virgin Media channels with either the remote or via Alexa. When I read that this Cube is compatible with Virgin Media, I thought it would control it too. It does however seem to be able to control Sky TV channels but not Virgin Media. So technically, the product description is not fully accurate.Even when I do change to Virgin Media, it sometimes takes about 10 seconds for the sound to kick in. I spoke to 4 agents via chat, and 3 via phone, with the 3rd one confirming at present the Cube cannot control channels for Virgin yet.Amazon says: ""Fire TV Cube lets you control your compatible cable and satellite set top box with your voice and Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote"" Any person reading this, incuding myself would assume this works with Virgin Media (especially when u click the link after that quote and see Virgin Media listed. The fact it doesn't, I think this is a bit misleading.Apart from the above, the sound and picture quality is amazing and crystal clear.Streaming quality (Netflix, Disney etc)- excellent and very fast.  Basic remote is included but no HDMI cable. I purchased a 2.1 HDMI cable which gives a stunning picture on both Virgin and the Cube. I have also two echo 5th Gen dots as my speakers. It also works flawlessly with my Ring Doorbell Pro 2.If you have a 4K Fire Stick already and are not fussed about connecting your sky or virgin, then no need to upgrade at all. If you just need the latest tech or want to connect sky/virgin, then get this while it is £119. I would not have got this at full price. If you want to get it to connect your PlayStation or Xbox, then don't - lags terribly. I think with a few software updates it will get better.",3.0,2022-11-21,United Kingdom 
RYBRV74U2H756,"The setup process is time consuming, forces upgrade immediately, is not intuitive even for a techie. At one point it said on the screen, after apparently turning off my TV, can I see the instructions, that is weird way to checking your process. The audio is another issue. The device has inbuilt speakers which don’t work. I have to always keep my external speaker always on. It also plays Alexa voice on top of songs that it is already playing, sounding weird and confusing. Not worth the money as one can buy Hisense TV at that cost.

R11VAPCRBIWKFF,"I bought this after having two (yes, two!!) firesticks go kaput after a little over a year's use in each. The cube is faster, more responsive and a much higher quality of streaming.And yet...it's still not great. It periodically freezes. Alexa randomly wakes up as though she's been summoned from the depths, even when she hasn't, and nobody has said anything even slightly resembling ""Alexa"". From time to time it stops recognising the remote control. Not all the Alexa integrations work - for example she will not restart the cube when asked to. Other times the sound goes out of sync with the show or film you're streaming - this has happened across all the apps I've used and can only be resolved by a restart.All in all, it's an upgrade, but it's not quite there yet. Hopefully newer models will resolve these bugs and hey, it's held on for longer than either of the sticks did, so fingers crossed.",4.0,2024-07-01,United Kingdom

R1D1OOWUJ36LL7,"Amazon Prime video’s quality through the Fire TV cube is comparable to that provided by the Apple TV app on an Apple 4K TV box. They are both brilliant.When connected to an audio receiver and speakers (capable of decoding hires and spatial audio), Amazon Music’s hi-res audio quality is, by its nature, technically superior to that currently possible from Apple Music via an Apple 4K TV box and receiver, HOWEVER….Both of Amazon Music’s Spatial Audio renderings of Atmos and 360 reality audio are (for now at least) being poorly executed by Amazon. Both multi channel music streams are simply FAR too quiet when compared to Amazon’s stereo hires audio steams, making it impossible to listen to playlists containing both mixed multi channel spatial audio and hires stereo audio without risking damage to speakers. Whilst you can prevent damage by switching on the sound normalisation option, this only serves to reduce the hires audio volume to that of the Spatial AudioWhen compared to Amazon’s own hi res audio, or Apple’s hi res and Spatial Audio, Amazon music’s current Spatial Audio offerings are disappointing at best.Given a fire tv appears to be one of the few pieces of equipment that enables an Amazon Music subscriber to output Atmos encoded music to speakers, Amazon need to address this in a future update as a priority.",4.0,2024-01-13,United Kingdom 
R3JVJ160TUNWQN,"Ok, so I bought the Amazon Fire TV Cube as I specifically wanted the new remote control.I also went Fire TV as I intended to use the Stereo option with 2 x Echo's.1) The stereo option is good,. although very occasionally loses connection but eventually stabilises for the most part.2) The new remote is better in terms of functionality BUT there is 1 annoying issue and 2 major issues.a) The remote comes with 4 ""media"" buttons. Two of these are Prime Video and Netflix - they are fine. A further 2 buttons come with random program associations - mine are Disney+ and Amazon Music. I don't use either of these and I would have appreciated being able to assign them to services that I DO use.b) The battery cover of the remote continually comes slightly loose. This is because there is no ""locking"" mechanism as most remotes use to prevent the cover coming loose. The battery slide/cover is continually coming slight loose.c) The quality of the main ""circle control"" is questionable. Mine already sticks to the right (this is likely the most used direction). This would seem to be a failure of the sensor underneath as there is no dirt or debris ingress anywhere.3) I did have the previous generation Fire TV Cube which in all honesty was to all intents and purposes just as good. The bump in specification is extremely minor in reality. The remote design is different, less buttons, but also it used a different battery and the battery cover was a better design.",3.0,2024-05-08,United Kingdom

R2X5802QRO3K2Q,"After purchasing a firestick 4k , I noticed the fire cube 3rd gen was on sale with £20 off . Decided to purchase one to find out what all the hype was about .  I could not see any difference in picture quality ( I have Oleds ) from the firestick 4k  and the Cube 3rd gen.  I did connect the Cube to wifi 6 along with 2 Echo studios ( took 3 hours , but that was down to me) as I had them on different WIFI settings and wouldn't make a Home cinema setup . Although it does sound nice with the studio speakers , it does not compare to my Onkyo system and speakers for Dolby Atmos .  Dolby Vision is fine on both the firestick 4k and the Cube 3rd gen . You can boost the internet speed using a usb to ethernet adapter as the ethernet port is only 10/100 . That is why i went with wifi 6 .  Loading screen is faster on the 3rd gen cubeThe let Downs are as follows .. cheap remote ( for what is meant to be a premium product) , NO HDMI lead , Usb 2  ( USB 3 or C would have been way better ) 10/100 port and not a gigabyte . Now comparing prices and built quality . The Nvidia Shield works out cheaper and has way better specs and more apps  , it has all you need straight out of the box . With the 3rd gen cube . £30 for a better remote , then the cost of a hdmi cable on top of that  . It makes the overall cost around the £170 mark .Basically you pay your money and take your choice . If you are heavily into Alexa for your home , then try the Cube . I am able to control my Shield via harmony remote and Alexa anyways .",4.0,2022-11-21,United Kingdom

It is hooked up to the TV via an HDMI lead, so when asking a question, and if the TV is off I hear nothing.  In the same room I have an echo Show, which answers at least 90% of the time, so the difference is Stark.Luckily I bought this on an Amazon Prime day so did not pay full price.

However the system still does not support Dolby Atmos - the internal diagnostics tool says it isn't available with my set up, despite the Fire TV Cube and Echo Studio all being advertised as Atmos compatible, so I still cannot recommend this product.Summary 1st October 2023: Don’t buy the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen for use with Echo speakers as a home cinema system, the feature isn’t available in the software it’s sold with and Amazon should not be advertising it as compatible. There is apparently a software update to resolve this, but Amazon has not made it available to download, so it doesn’t work for me and I’ve got no idea when it will be available.Bought this alongside 2 Echo Studios to use a home cinema system. After multiple hours of failed set up and troubleshooting, turns out the firmware version the Fire TV Cube ships with isn’t compatible with Alexa Home Cinema, so cannot be used with dual Echo speakers in stereo, despite being advertised for this feature.Updating the firmware doesn’t work, it won’t update past version 7.2. Apparently version 7.9 has the Home Cinema feature, but Amazon are currently not making this available to download, so the feature doesn’t exist. Multiple complaints in the Amazon support forums with the same issue are going unresolved for over a month.The Echo studios have optical audio inputs, so I’ve bought a splitter and hope to run them both from my Samsung TV output.

R21U59LXPP0BR6,"Physically it’s a nicer device than the previous model, however, I bought two; one to use with my projector and one to use with my TV and (Virgin) set top box.I set the projector one up first, which all went smoothly, however, I’m having issues where Alexa’s voice is hardly audible.The second box is connected to my TV with my Virgin Media box connected to the Fire TV Cube. Firstly the Fire TV Cube can’t control the Virgin box despite it being listed as compatible on Amazon’s website (they may have been referring to the older TiVo software, but I’m using the Virgin 360 software). I’m also having the same Alexa volume issues with the TV. Sometimes she at normal volume, but mostly you can hardly hear her. I also tried viewing my Ring doorbell on the TV Cube, which worked, however, there’s no way to dismiss the video feed; it offers up example phrases to use like “dismiss Picture in Picture “ but Alexa then just advises that she can’t do that yet 🤦🏻‍♂️. So I ended up having to restart the box to get rid of the camera feed. I think I’m going to give it a few more days to see if I can get around any of these issues but if not I think I’ll be returning both boxes unfortunately.UPDATE: it appears that the Alexa voice volume issue relates to the Sonos skill. Removing the Sonos skill and Sonos speakers from the Alexa app appears to have completely cured this particular issue for some reason 🤷🏻‍♂️.Update 2: I’ve noticed that sometimes the audio will go out of sync quite badly and would require a restart of the cube for it to be back to normal again. As an example I recently watched Interstellar which required me to restart the cube 3 times throughout the film to keep things in sync. This was being watched using the Apple TV app and appears to be the problem as when I watch anything through either the Prime Video or Disney Plus apps this doesn’t happen. I also noticed that when this happens it affects everything else afterwards and not just the Apple TV app if you leave it. Even moving around the Fire TV interface the noise of moving through selections is badly delayed. Fortunately I also have an Apple TV box to watch my Apple purchases on as they just aren’t watchable for me through the Apple TV app on the cube.

When pressing one of the preset buttons on the remote, such as Netflix, or Prime, it always goes to a 'Media' page that shows 'No Content'. This is clearly bad programming and needs to be fixed asap with an update.2. Connecting a set-top-box to the HDMI in port quite often (like every morning) results in the signal from the STB being disconnected with a message about digital rights management or something similar.3. The picture quality from the HDMI in port quite often stutters every 10 seconds, like it's at the wrong frame rate or something - even though I have the frame rate option set to Auto. I have also tried various other fixed options but it makes no difference.4. Speaking to other Alexa devices around the house results in the Cube muting the TV even though it doesn't actually respond to that particular question. And yes, I have disabled the 'Favour this device' option in the Cube's software, but it makes no difference.5. Sometimes it gets confused over whether to talk to you via its internal speaker or the surround system speakers, and you have to say ""Alexa, I can't hear you"", before it'll respond through the correct speaker.All these issues will hopefully be fixed with various firmware updates in the future.Overall, I'm fairly happy with it.",4.0,2022-11-24,United Kingdom

The cube itself has a sleek and modern design that immediately makes it stand out. The package included everything needed to get started: the cube, power adapter, IR extender cable, and Ethernet adapter.Usage Experience:Setting up the Fire TV Cube was straightforward, and connecting it to my Wi-Fi was a breeze thanks to the Wi-Fi 6E compatibility. The cube provides a crisp 4K Ultra HD streaming experience that truly elevates watching movies and TV shows. But the real game-changer is Alexa; with hands-free control, I could do everything from adjusting the volume to changing the channel with just my voice, which made the whole experience more seamless and enjoyable.Target Audience:The Fire TV Cube is a fantastic device for tech enthusiasts who want to upgrade their home entertainment system.

R2WNIK8Y6N95BK,"I bought this to remove the annoying usb power cable dangling below my wall mounted TV. This and the prospect of connecting over Ethernet were the prime considerations.Unfortunately, which ever option I tried to connect the Cube either direct to TV or via AV receiver, the picture quality could not match that of my Firestick 4K Max. I used the same TV HDMI port to connect the Cube as used for the Firestick and, I tried different cables with some improvement, but that is covered later.The connection via AV Receiver is very good when using 4k Blu-Ray and Freesat HD as a source, so I didn't think that was a factor.The upside of the Cube was that my AV receiver would detect the full sound protocol of the programme whereas the Firestick only detects basic digital (I assume the TV is the limitation masking the sound signal). The response and speed of app loading was much quicker on the Cube but picture quality is paramount to me so it doesn't have enough over the Firestick.In addition, the broadband over WiFi and ethernet was comparable between the Cube and Firestick but I knew WiFi was not a limitation anyway.Basically, in any installation, additional connections means loss (which is compounded by length of the interconnect) and for me, this is where the Firestick is superior (direct connection).The Cube has been returned.

We were also on the lookout for an echo for the living room, so went for the Fire TV Cube as it’s hitting 2 birds with one stone!First off packaging seems pretty eco friendly. Not much plastic, mostly paper. Only downside is that there’s no HDMI included. Why was this omitted? You literally need one to use it! Luckily I had one spare.After connecting to Wi-Fi and setting up my account (I’m pretty sure I selected to set up my account when I purchased it, what’s the point in this option when purchasing?), I immediately noticed a difference in terms of speed and snappiness. It’s a lot faster at opening apps and navigating the UI is very smooth.Having an echo essentially built in is great too. I use Alexa to navigate the UI and ask her to play content a lot more than I did with the remote on my 4K Fire stick. It only takes a few seconds from receiving a command to actioning it!Speaking of remotes, it does come with one, but I expected the premium remote, not the one it comes with. Unfortunately the premium controller is an extra purchase, but I doubt I’ll go for it as the voice assistant works so well!I’m only on day one of ownership at the moment, but I do not regret my purchase at all!

R1N4A99CRJO50T,"Bought this new 4K UHD cube to upgrade from an older model, first impressions are the picture and quality are brilliant without a doubt speed is much better, installation is quick.... mine is connected to Sky Q, LG tv, & a soundbar as was the previous model I had, however the most important  issue for me was the sound and response from the cube when speaking commands to it.After many attempts to try and sync this by re installing it if I spoke a command to the cube when tv was Off no reply , it worked when tv was on only .I did contact amazon's help line and was given a link to try again different to the one in the supplied instructions.It read hold down the Mute button and the Volume  down button Together for 40 seconds until the light bar turned Blue the cube beebs every second while doing this.Then I did a normal installation again , not sure if this did the trick or not , but after 3 days of trying to correct it, it suddenly seemed to sort itself out and now perfectl tv on or off.Personally I think it needed an other UPGRADE which can happen anytime while its plugged in.If your on Facebook I advise you join the group ,Amazon alexa UK users, this group has some great techies on there who offer some great adviceAmazon did offer to replace my cube if the link didn't work but its working for me now so time will tell, gotta add I'm really impressed with difference in quality of picture. 1 tip tho make sure your hdmi cable is a 4K ultra high speed one £5 from Amazon.",5.0,2023-07-18,United Kingdom

RIQVTN9NC1FMB,"I have owned many, many Android streaming devices and I always keep coming back to the Fire devices. I recommend them to my friends.....Because the Amazon range of streaming devices are probably the best you can get on the market - why? Because it comes down to one thing - device support. With updates and the might of Amazon behind it, nothing else really comes close. Yes there's the Nvdia Shield (expensive) and Google's Chromecast with Android TV(laggy), Apple TV (no sideload, no Android apps) but they too have limitations - they simply don't support some of the apps you want - very recently, this was the NOW app. Not much use to me. In fact I sold my Shield for a Cube. The cube is actually amongst the most powerful devices you can buy. Yes, it is kinda expensive, but it does have Alexa built in, plus a speaker and a damn powerful streamer in there. I waited for a sale and then traded in an old Firestick and got a hefty 47 odd quid off!The Cube (and any Fire stick) will support any Android app and if it's not in the Amazon App store, you can easily sideload using the Downloader app / or EasyFireTools. You can easily use the device/s as a hub and if searching, it will search across any app you have installed.  With the Cube, Alexa is quick to respond to all commands. It was a breeze to setup to control my TV and soundbar. I have multiple Firesticks around the house and they are all easy to setup - I could not recommend these more over generic Android, unsupported streaming devices.",5.0,2023-03-31,United Kingdom

R1BWYE2AS6CBWG,"This is a tidy piece of kit and smaller than it looks. The reason I upgraded from the 4k stick was the memory was double and I was running out of space and the capability of some apps were struggling.It’s mega easy to set up plug in and attach to your tv with s HDMI cable. Now this is very important. It doesn’t come with a cable which for the price is scandalous, however there is a known fault on these boxes if you don’t have a decent HDMI cable of the screen going black for 1/2 seconds and then back to what you were watching and this can be on any app. I had an old HDMI from my rarely used dvd and this happened regularly first night.Did some research got a 8k capable HDMI cable (0.5 meters, smaller the better) for about £6.50 on prime and the black screen fault hasn’t returned.Obv this has much more capability with sound bars and works as an echo dot too but I wanted to warn  others of this potential problem.So get a 4k/8k cable !!!!",4.0,2023-02-01,United Kingdom 
RYKMMT6ADCDFH,"Firstly I'd like to add that this is completely different from the 2nd gen cube, this will upscale your pictures, along with finally fixing the issue of when your watching a station on TV Ariel it will play the sound through the home cinema system, that I own. The 2md gen did not have this. This works by plugging in your hdmi from the TV out source on the cube and connect it to the hdmi arc or earc port on your TV. It also has another hdmi port so you can connect a games console, sky,BT box, projector to it. And then it will also play sound through the home cinema system. The 2nd gen did not have this. Having this system also denotes the need for Bluetooth on your TV set. Finally Amazon have got this little beast of a system right. It's well worth the little bit extra it costs compared to the 2nd gen. With all these capabilities, it makes it a game changer for the Amazon streaming devices.I would highly recommend this product to anyone. It's well worth the upgrade from the 2nd gen. And along with the new Amazon fire TV remote it's out of this world. The only one flaw I have with this is that you can still only connect two of the same speakers and a sub , I would love to see an option of being able to group all of your Amazon speakers, ie 4th and 5th gen echos along with the echo studios and a sub. Basically to give you home surround sound 5.1 or 7.1. other than that I'm very happy with the new fire cube.",5.0,2023-01-08,United Kingdom 
RN5VBT020SRWX,"I purchased the Amazon Fire Cube 3 over a year ago and have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the picture quality is excellent, and the bonus of being able to plug in another product to the HDMI port simultaneously is a great feature. However, I've encountered a frustrating issue where the device occasionally restarts itself without warning and also it's ridiculous how fast the batteries run out.Another downside is the bloatware of ads that come with the Fire Cube. It's quite intrusive and detracts from the overall user experience. Because of these issues, I've decided to try out Google products instead. It's a shame since I already own a lot of Amazon's tech and generally appreciate their ecosystem, but the instability and ads are deal-breakers for me.",3.0,2024-05-22,United Kingdom

R3HI3RGA39C5DS,"I bought this thinking I could get the best out of the HDMI In feature and 4K upscaling. Instead, I was left frustrated. The HDMI In worked fine in getting a connection on out of my SKY HD Box, but there was issues in the FPS when viewing Sky channels. The only way you can get smooth quality is by changing the Display to 2160 50fps. Which is fine, but when you want to watch 4K 60FPS videos on YouTube, there would be stuttering. I tried changing the display to Automatic, but this never help switch anything, with or without the Auto framerate on. After trying my HDMI cable on different ports, I just gave up. Also, worth noting, the upscaling wasn't anything that stood out, in fact my picture quality for my SKY channels was better on 1080p!As for other functions, the UI was not smoother than my 2nd Gen Fire Cube, I experienced some lag and delays on the 3rd Gen.The Fire Cube is still a brilliant piece of kit and worth getting if this is your first purchase.

While it connects, it was impossible to get it to control the channels properly. It just get getting confused and to make matters worse, when the Cube gets confused, it just hangs and crashes.I an a techno geek and I was so disappointed with the Fire Cube so much so that I gave up and sent it back to Amazon for a refund.I would say that the Fire Tv Cube is still a work-in-progress and not yet a finished product.  Amazon development need to go back to the labs to make it work as well as the Fire 4k Tv stick works with most home Tv/Multimedia systems.If you already have the Fire 4k Tv stick, then I would suggest that you stay with that and give the Fire Cube a miss until Amazon actually release a product that is fit for use.",2.0,2024-07-10,United Kingdom

RI3TQI6U5G8U7,"Extremely impressed, the one word I'd use to describe my experience so far is flawless.  I've previously owned the Chromecast 4k, which is a nice smart device, if slightly sluggish at times.  Then the Nvidia Shield 2019, which is a good improvement in performance but for me had some occasional issues with compatibility and bugs (Ethernet bug for instance and slightly flaky bluetooth on some devices).  With this FireTV Cube not only is the performance there (if anything its even faster than my shield), but it just seems to work all the time every time.  I had a issue with my speakers on the shield where I would have to turn them on manually and adjust volume manually (since I switched to Optical instead of HDMI ARC).  But the FireTV Cube effortlessly synced with the speakers in the same setup and they now turn on with the TV and I can even control them with my voice..  Even a pair of Bluetooth headphones that had problems with my shield work without fuss here, the Wifi is twice as fast, the voice activation works perfectly every time.

I'm not talking about it having restricted adult content, I mean they simply can't use it, at all. We have multiple echoes around the house and my kids have their own profiles, so Alexa recognises who's talking to it. They can do everything with any other device, but not the cube. My kids can't ask it sums, they can't play music, they can't turn the lights on, it won't do a thing if it recognises a childs voice. My missus had set an alarm & then couldn't turn it off because the cube thought she was one of our daughters, she literally had to pull the power out. On another note, I bought this to replace an old FireTV & an echo show. The first thing we missed is the clock, it's amazing how you don't realise how you rely on something until it isn't there. Then I tried to play music, and it turned the TV on to play the music through that instead of on the cube itself. The first day I had it, I was talking to it and not getting any response. Took me a minute to figure out it was responding through the TV even though the TV was off so I couldn't hear anything.

My phone, Chromebooks and tablets never have any issues on my WiFi....

It's also incredibly compact and takes up barely any space.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality, which is more than adequate for casual music listening or podcasts.While it's not perfect, the downsides are minor considering the price.  The audio is decent but obviously not high-fidelity, lacking a bit in bass and overall volume. You also might need to experiment with placement a bit to get the best sound since it projects upwards.  If you're looking for a simple, affordable way to add Alexa to your bedroom or another small space, I'd definitely recommend the Echo Pop.",5.0,2024-12-24,United Kingdom

R2PS3EFTNRHFFD,"I’ve taken off one star, cos I just feel it doesn’t quite live up to my previous Echo Dot. Then again, it’s cheaper, so really that’s fair enough I suppose. I think I would grit my teeth and pay the extra for the Dot next time, but I was on a very tight budget at the time. I actually may return it and get the Dot if I feel the need. Sorry to be vague, I can’t really put my finger on it, but it seems to drop connection to my smart bulb far too often, which I know is a genuine first world problem, but it just winds me up! It’s meant to save time and effort, but if it decides to ignore me 50% of the time, I then have to faff around and that’s not the idea at all. Audio quality is fine for me, I don’t expect a symphony orchestra at this level, I just want it to do it’s job reliably!",4.0,2025-03-20,United Kingdom 
R31Q0377ZZ6VLI,"My girlfriend loves this device but I'm somewhat on the fence. The device is fully functional, the speaker quality isn't awful and Alexa is quite receptive to commands and it is easy to use. My main issue is that it must be plugged in at all times for it to function, although this does mean that there is no worrying about battery life. In terms of the value for money it's really good as the device is relatively cheap",4.0,2025-03-11,United Kingdom 
R2OBM3QKA5VBAC,"Most of our family have an Alexa device, so I decided to get one for my grandmother. It was great value for money as I got it during a sale. It is definitely an improvement in sound quality over previous generations of the Alexa.One criticism that I have of the Alexa (and it may be possible to disable this - I haven’t checked yet) is that at random times it will tell you tips about how you can ask for certain things. This is great for some, but my gran found it confusing. I got her this as a replacement for an old stereo so she could listen to digital radio. They’re quite difficult to setup if you already have an Alexa on another account though. I had to set her up her own account for it so I could link Spotify to it (her own account I setup), but I had to log out of my Alexa app and start afresh there. Would be easier if it were possible to set this up on a laptop/website rather than just the app. Also annoying that you have to have a mobile number for registration, as I imagine there will be many OAPs without mobiles.Overall a great quality device, just the setup process could do with some improvements.",5.0,2025-01-12,United Kingdom 
R3O98Z5I7U83SO,"Impressive Sound in a Compact Package with Minor LimitationsI’ve been using the Echo Pop for a few weeks now, and it’s exceeded my expectations for such a small and affordable smart speaker! It’s compact, looks great in charcoal, and does a fantastic job as both a Bluetooth speaker and a smart device with Alexa built in. There are a few areas for improvement, but overall, it’s a solid addition to my home setup. Here’s what I found:Pros: 1. Great Sound for the Size: The audio quality is impressive for such a compact device. It delivers a clear, balanced sound that fills a small to medium-sized room well. It’s not on par with larger speakers in terms of bass, but it definitely gets the job done for casual listening. 2. Alexa is Responsive & Helpful: Alexa works well on the Echo Pop. The voice recognition is solid, even from across the room, and it’s super convenient to set reminders, control smart home devices, check the weather, and play music without lifting a finger. It has the full Alexa functionality, which makes it feel more versatile than a simple Bluetooth speaker. 3. Compact Design Fits Anywhere: This speaker is so small and stylish that it fits just about anywhere—from a kitchen counter to a bookshelf. The charcoal color is sleek and modern, blending in with most decor styles, and it feels like it belongs no matter where you put it. 4. Good Connectivity Options: It’s convenient having both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality. Streaming over Wi-Fi gives higher-quality sound than Bluetooth, but it’s nice to have the option to connect quickly via Bluetooth when needed.Cons: 1. Limited Bass Performance: While the sound quality is good, the bass is limited due to its compact size. It’s fine for casual music listening and spoken audio, but if you’re a bass lover or want rich, deep sound, you might find it lacking compared to larger speakers in the Echo line. 2. Not Ideal for Large Rooms: This speaker does a great job in small or medium rooms, but it struggles a bit in larger spaces. It doesn’t quite have the power to fill a big room, so it’s best suited for personal or smaller spaces. 3. Limited Customization for Sound: Unlike some other Echo devices, there are fewer options to customize the audio profile. A few EQ adjustments are available in the Alexa app, but they’re basic. This may not bother everyone, but for those who like to tailor sound profiles, it’s a bit limiting.Final Thoughts:The Echo Pop is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a compact, budget-friendly smart speaker with great Alexa functionality and decent sound quality. It’s ideal for personal spaces or small rooms, and the convenience of Alexa combined with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support makes it a versatile device. The sound quality is impressive for its size, though bass lovers may find it a bit light.If you’re looking for a stylish, affordable speaker that handles the basics with ease and doesn’t take up much space, the Echo Pop is a great option. It’s not perfect, but it’s a strong performer for the price, and I’m happy with the value it adds to my home.",4.0,2024-11-02,United Kingdom 
R3LMW421B5CUI2,its is amazing have had it for a few months and i love it it responds quickly and you can make phone calls and listen to music at high volumes. if you are bored you can even play games with it its is a very good investment and by far my best purchase this year,5.0,2025-03-05,United Kingdom 
R3TUAMHT2QA4E3,"For how small this little thing is, the sound quality and level of bass output are more than to scale - the only negative being the maximum volume leaves a bit to be desired!Interconnectivity features through the Alexa app are brilliant, love how you can configure multiple units in one room (or around a Fire TV) to create a sound surround system, and the “Play Everywhere” feature on Spotify (would assume Apple Music has an equivalent too) is brilliant to have music throughout the entire house/ flat if you have echo units dotted around in multiple rooms - would advise at least one Echo Show 5 (or bigger) for best Echo benefits, but the echo pops (and/ or dots) are brilliant units to have in other rooms.(Wait for a sale though as they go half price [or better than] at least twice annually , I’m not mental enough to have paid full price to kit out the entire house with smart speakers 😂😂)",5.0,2025-01-12,United Kingdom

R1FVHQP62MD07O,"If you are an African and you are thinking of getting the Alexa Echo Pop, you need to know certain things before you do. And this review will help you decide whether it is worth the large sum in your own currency. To start off, it really depends where you get the Alexa from, as getting it directly from retailers is much more expensive than buying it from amazon, however, Amazon delivery does make it even more costlier. It would be better if you know someone who can bring it for you for free.Now is it worth your money?Advantages:-works really well as a speaker, really loud. It is especially useful if you like playing music.-great personal assistant when it comes to noting reminders, taking notes, making lists, timer and alarms.-It is a plus to have if you have Alexa compatible smart devices like the amazon fire stick, or a smart tv that can be paired.-Recognizes voices of different profiles really well.-other smart devices that have their own company apps can be paired with the Alexa app.-Connects to Spotify and apple music. Provides amazon music as well.-News updates which can also be connected with your accounts on other news channel apps.-Can have Alexa set to give certain answers to certain questions.-Recognizes when you cough and do other vocal activities where she can give suggestions or comments to have you feel better (personal assistant things).-You can make her fart and beatbox LOL.Disadvantages:-expensive in your own currency (in Tanzania I got it around 90,000-100,000 directly purchased from amazon and free delivery cause someone travelled and brought it back for me. That amount in our country is quite like how $100 is valued in the US).-If you don't have smart devices you will only enjoy the minimal note taking ability of Alexa. You can always buy a smart plug and convert any regular electrical appliance to be sort of smart through Alexa via voice command. I did this to our TV, but it only turns the switch on and off, the rest is remote controlled even though our TV is smart it isn't smart enough for Alexa just google.-The feature of traffic data, weather data and alerts, and ETA cannot be used if amazon is not available in your country, rather Alexa will give the details of the country the domain you use is in. My account is in UK, because I travel to the UK, but traveling for trivial things is a shame and quite wasteful when I could just buy it at an overpriced 3rd party retail price. LOL.-News is only limited to the International news. If asking for specific news it will try its best to give you the information, but since it is based on only the information fed by amazon, it does not give updates on my country (Tanzania) which are relatively recent. But that is not the same if you enjoy watching international news more.-Similarly, many of the features on the Alexa app cannot be used because you are not in said country where your account is (check website domain ending).Overall, I purchased it because its primary purpose of being a virtual assistant is actually commendable. Literally like having your own personal assistant taking down your thoughts and to dos. However, many of the features that Alexa is advertised for is not delivered at the countries where amazon is not established (no existing domain). Really it is a win-loose kind of purchase. As long as you rejoice with the winning part you will be satisfied with your purchase.",4.0,2023-11-08,United Kingdom

R1RWWNBMALMR58,"I bought this Echo Pop to replace the Echo Dot I've had beside my bed for a few years now.I'm confined to bed 99% of the time after spinal damage in a car accident many years ago, which now causes sitting and standing to be excruciatingly painful.I listen to music 24/7 and can't sleep without it.I like the fact that the speaker is directable towards me and not all the way around in a circle.As a result, the sound is much clearer and obviously not muffled when in a confined space.The only issue I have with it is that I find the buttons difficult to locate, being on the upper side of the rear of the device.You see, I have several other health issues, too, one of which is degenerative sensation in my hands. They're not completely numb - yet - but will be before too long.I have used little self adhesive bubble bumpers that are designed to stop cupboard doors and similar from banging in the past, but they have a tendency to fall off after a while.It would be nice if the designers of these gadgets took into consideration that these items are going to be of more substantial benefit to people who are differently-abled than the majority of the population, and if they took such things into consideration by making control buttons a little more prominent rather than streamlining them with the rest of the products surface.This would not only benefit differently-abled people, but would also make things easier for able bodied people, too, meaning that they could locate the controls without having to move the item and look for the buttons, and identify which one to press!What would make a HUGE difference to differently-abled people would also benefit able bodied people, and I'm very surprised that Amazon's designers haven't considered these extra selling points.When the ""ball"" shaped Echo speaker was advertised pre-launch, I was very interested in the one that had a light up digital clock in it.I wrote in asking about the size of the digits, as I also have a degenerative vision problem, and nobody from Amazon even bothered to respond to my questions!I would have given the Echo Pop 5 stars but for the streamlined buttons that I'm struggling to locate already, and that's a shame.Being confined to bed means that I have used quite a few of Amazon's products to control my environment, and I've lost count of how many Kindle devices I have possessed, going right back to the very first keyboard device in early 2012.Amazon, please consider your differently-abled customers who really benefit the most from your product lines, not just as a luxury, but more as a necessity, especially when living alone like I do.These 'gadgets' make a huge difference in our lives, so PLEASE make their controls a little easier to locate and more accessible - or offer a small remote control, or something!However, back to the sound quality of the Echo Pop - it definitely surpasses the Dot, even on low volume, which is about all I use considering I live in a flat in a converted house which doesn't have very good soundproofing!This was my Christmas present to myself, and I'm so glad I treated myself to it!",4.0,2024-01-22,United Kingdom

RC2S108ZFM2QJ,"The 'Pop' as the low-end speaker seems to get a lot of flack for its lack of features, but if you catch it on sale like I did, it is still a great little device. I use two as a 'stereo pair' with a firestick for general streaming and TV watching and they far outperform the built-in TV speakers. I like that they are more directional than the circular Amazon devices, which for me produces a more precise, less muddy, sound.For dedicated music listening via Spotify etc, I used the 'play everywhere' option to also stream to the regular 'Echo' turned down a little which adds some weight for a surprisingly immersive 2.1 sound. All at bargain black Friday prices!Lots of uses and cute design and colours. About the only thing I don't like is the power adapter size and the fact it, and it's trailing wire is white, regardless of the speaker colour and the reliance on the app for settings and set-up.I didn't think I'd ever use Alexa-enabled devices but now I'm looking for more, I'm suddenly seeing the convenience on offer.",5.0,2024-11-26,United Kingdom

The volume and sound cancelling buttons are clearly on the top and easy to see.As I previously had an echo to set up was ultra easy. Done in seconds. Putting an app on the phone you can modify Echo's voice. There are several different voices English, American and Canadian. Plus you can choose what sex you want the voice to be. There is also a place on the app, where you can call Echo a different name if you don't fancy Echo. There is also about 6 choices. I did try a different name. But I ended up confusing myself as I have always called my Echo- Echo.Another new thing is the lights. Several lights can come on now-ranging from yellow to green all with different meanings.Included in the box is warranty information and a really good little instruction booklet.This covers1 Meet your Echo pop2 Set up your Echo pop3 Learn about the light bar.4 Privacy and support5 Things to try with AlexiaThe booklet is easy to understand, easy to read and has pictures to explain things.Finally, it comes complete with a separate power adaptor.I like this new Echo pop, comes with a long wire.

R91EOL2OVLZAV,"I didn't get this at full price - I needed a speaker, and bought it when it was £25. It's designed by people who think everything tech has to be an orb or an egg or a demilunette. The design is plasticky, I hate the buttons, there is no voice recognition (even for me - an honorary Charlotte Greene, RP-speaking nauseating person with no regional accent - so it's the tech, not you), and it definitely requires your phone or another device to work, which should be a recent model. But there are fun colours, and it's very small, so the fact that the speaker packs a punch in the kitchen makes it a no-brainer for my new house. You can acquire fixtures and fittings to mount it on the wall, which I'll get round to when I've painted and decorated. Right now, this is perfect for morning breakfast podcast cooking sessions and when working at home. It doesn't have the panache of Denon or the roundel squidginess of Sonos, but to be honest I'm annoyed it's not made of oak or tweed or something - but it rally will do for now, and I can just have music on while charging my phone. I have not been able to connect it to my Macbook to enhance sound for films etc, although the notes in the box say you could buy several and have them all play the same music all over the house.The advice with Alexa remains to not position these speakers in the bedroom, even in the notes as Alexa 'listens.' Alexa can only listen if it's switched on, but mostly I find it useless anyway - I ignore the speaking features most of the time as the voice recognition software is shite. Honestly, I have the most clear voice imaginable and it still gets it wrong so I gave up and I'm happy with that. It works well, as does a Rockbox in my shower, for classical music and rock etc. I'm not going to be throwing house parties any time soon, but for dinner party atmosphere and little occasions, it's absolutely fine.

You get 30 frames a second, With 720p & 2K picture quality, Well beyond 1080p HD, it’s true HDNot a gimmick word for you to buy it the quality is that amazing. You can read a number plate on a moving car, you can turn the mic up the sensitivity of the pet car person detection ,It Also will hear crying glass breaking barking etc & let you know , you can turn all these off.I have mine all indoors & some pointing out windows, the NV is really good you can set it to far or near it has no red light but will blur on a window the night vision, if there is light outside a street light you won’t need the night vision I leave mine on day at 2K 30Frames per second recordingYou will need a Class 10 Micro SD card , Imo go a sandisc extreme pro , As think about it your recording 2K & 30Fps & Sound none stop onto the card & it will loop when it’s full . A 128Gb with these settings will record for a week or more,But if you record in less I.e 25 or 20Fps you will get weeks & way longer at 720p & it is true HD even at 720p not like others I’ve hadThe only Con I have is I wish the lead was longer . It’s 1.5 meters so 99% of the time more than enoughI set it up in 10-15 mins so easy to set up , And a day or 2 of playing with the App it’s so user friendly & the staff are amazing they get back to you in hours & check in days later to make sure your ok & ask do you need more helpThere Customers Service Is that good I’m buying only TAPO smart items, the quality of Tapo at the price with the features is a no brainer. I love this company & there quality customer support who truly care & make sure everything is sorted.It has never dropped connection I’ve a few going & getting more.

R98UL0SKV1JDI,"I started using the Tapo C225 camera as a baby monitor, and it’s proven to be an incredible choice, especially compared to traditional baby monitors. The night vision and video quality really stand out, making this a reliable and cost-effective option for any parent.Pros: 1. Exceptional Night Vision: The camera’s night vision is crystal clear. It easily captures everything in my baby’s room, even in total darkness. I can clearly see my child’s movements without any grainy or blurry footage, which gives me peace of mind overnight. 2. High-Quality Video: The camera delivers high-definition video, ensuring I can monitor every detail in the room during the day. The clarity far exceeds what most baby monitor devices offer, especially those in the same price range. The 4MP resolution provides sharp and vibrant images. 3. Motion and Sound Detection: Beyond just video quality, the Tapo C225 has intelligent motion and sound detection that sends real-time alerts to my phone. If my baby stirs or makes noise, I get an instant notification, allowing me to respond quickly. 4. Cheaper Than Traditional Baby Monitors: Baby monitors with similar features (video, sound alerts, and night vision) tend to be significantly more expensive, and often lack the video quality of the Tapo C225. Instead of spending money on a standalone monitor, I’ve found this camera offers everything I need at a fraction of the cost. 5. Mobile App Convenience: Instead of relying on a clunky handheld monitor, the Tapo app on my phone allows me to check the camera feed from anywhere. It’s much more convenient to have everything integrated into my phone, especially since I always have it with me.Cons: 1. Wi-Fi Dependent: As with most smart devices, the camera relies on a stable Wi-Fi connection. If the connection drops or weakens, there can be interruptions in the feed. However, I haven’t encountered significant issues with this in my experience.In summary, the Tapo C225 is a high-quality, feature-packed camera that works wonderfully as a baby monitor. Its superior night vision and HD video quality easily rival (or even surpass) expensive traditional baby monitors, all while being much more affordable. If you’re looking for a reliable and economical solution, this camera is a perfect fit for new parents. The number 1 reason that I chose this over other alternatives, is the close up night vision uses invisible infrared, meaning their are no red lights coming from this camera, completely dark.",5.0,2024-09-11,United Kingdom 
RHELY13NXTGJQ,"I purchased the C225 after being let down 3 times by Reolink on the baby crying feature which we really needed for our new born.I have always been a huge fan of tp-link. They really do offer incredible value for money.Tp-link have always just worked and worked well.I have multiple Reolink cameras and these are great but in comparison the features you get with tapo make them a serious contender with the traditional camera only brands.It tracks everything if you want, people, pets, vehicles etc.It detects baby crying, glass breaking and pet noises.Auto tracking, alarm, local and remote storage.It’s a lot of camera for very little money.Well worth purchasing if you are unsure.Would love to see a Poe range then tapo would have everything.Highly recommend",5.0,2025-02-02,United Kingdom 
R1IBAN7BAAIEQ1,"I had done extensive research on a little home CCTV systems, that are wifi enabled that would just allow for some peace of mind when we're away. I've looked into every feasible system out there from those like Tapo right up to the very expensive products on the market-some costing tens of thousands with complex home installation packages.It's incredible that this small CCTV at a cost of just £20 surpassed so many of the features, and picture quality, provided in the more expensive CCTV products and installation packages. A real win here is that there are no monthly fees, with the only additional requirements needed being wifi and SD card- recommended 128gb upwards (approx£12).The picture quality is exceptional, so too is the app which is laid out simply. I was worried about how difficult it would be to get this set up, but it was a case of firstly downloading the Tapo app then being led by on screen instructions. You couldn't go a step wrong with any of it!The app itself allows you to manoeuvre the camera, speak through it, playback and record. It's small enough to be quite discrete too.So far, I've bought 5 of these which are now all linked to the app. It gives much needed peace of mind, and provided as very comprehensive system that cost no more than £100. I can't recommend this product enough, especially if like me you get all a bit blinded by the tech talk and worry over how to get a camera installed in the first place. 5 stars all the way with this!",5.0,2025-02-08,United Kingdom 
R21UIC54O84BWC,"Works better than I expected! I thought this would be one of those yt video camera footage video representative where its grainy and nothing can be made out. Oh was i wrong 1080p quality is doinb wonders. Perfect for small rooms and back garden. Installing on the wall is a breeze with the included guide and screws.Pan and tilt works nicely and can be automated to move at given intervals to given positions. Many settings are managed in the tapo app.You do NOT need to have an sd card for it to work as a live cam. Sd card is only for local recording. NVR is also supported frigate integrates nicely with this cam recording and detecfion of movement works with a 0.5or so secobd delay and the features are nice.Integrating to home assistant is simple with frigate hacs custom component, but the atreams took me a while to figure out for a live view in 2 tools frigate and hone assistant simultaneously. /stream1 over rtsp is the hd 1080p stream and /stream2 is the 720p one, since the tapo app uses the 1080p stream or the 720p one depebding on your config it can be viewed there without issues.Hovewer this cam obly supports 2 rtsp streams and you can only use 1 stream concurrently so no way to use 1080p in frigate AND home assistant, pick which obe gets the worse resolution and configure accordingly.Rtsp streams are notorious to only show live when you request/querry it so use the frigate cam card in hone assistant to get a live rolling view as that querries every second.Installation is easy just a power cable, long obe at that, and a wifi.",5.0,2025-03-15,United Kingdom

R254MMJCFRAT6C,"Day 1- setup was a breeze, I already have the Tapo app as I have other devices...so just add device, select camera, then the appropriate camera from the dropdown selection and it added itself in less than a monute....a good start.The first issue discovered was the limited downward tilt of the lens. My intended location is on a shelf with the intention of monitoring my dog post-surgery, this location was not possible as the limitation of the lens rotation downward prevented the camera from seeing all the floor area.So a new location would need to be found. This problem would be aleviated by ceiling mounting (the viev can be inverted via the app) as tje lens would pan down almost perpendicular, however yhis presented he problem of having the power cord dangling down the wall. A possible solution would-be to run a length of white self adhesive conduit down the wall to disguise (sort of) the ugly wire. Something to consider but requires more work and expense, for now, l will configure to my requirements and test.Seemed to work ok for the first day, then issues started to manifest.Overnight 1- Whilst detecting my dog sleeping overnight it continually recorded instead of only recording upon movement. Continuous recording is unnecessary whilst my dog is asleap and just fills up the sd card.Day 2- The camera dropped out several times the second day (stating ""camera offline"") in the app, so it had to be power cycled to  get it online again.Whilst working, it regularly reports ""unstable network""  then suggests changing to low resolution mode (720p).... so there is no point in buying the camera for the claimed 2k resolution if it is incapable of sustaining it.Replaying clips. - the thumbnails are often slow to load, then when clicking to view them I get the ""unstable network"" message and unable to view, so useless.Tracking mode- the camera does pick up a moving object when set to do so (human & dog tested) however a few seconds after the movement stops the camera pans away back to its starting view so the object that has been tracked is now no longer visible, and, now being out of view is no longer tracked until it enters the camera view again....a serious security flaw. The camera should surely remain on the (now stationary ) tracked person to record what they are up to rather than panning away....very poor implementation.I tested remotely from my home to check if it can be accessed remotely. I tested it a number of times, I was able to access the feed ok.Evening- we were out for the evening, regularly checking on my dog, I was able to access the camera feed on every attempt without issue.Day 3 - woke to the blue light on the camera flashing this morning, indicating a fault and the live camera feed was not functioning (again), so rinse and repeat time with power cycling to reset. Checking the app there were no overnight recordings registered.Same issue with tracking.... my moving dog is tracked until it ceases to move, then the camera pans away back to the previous position, so my dog is now no longer ""In-shot"" unless  I manually pan.Privacy mode- I have set privacy to switch off when I leave home and switch it back on upon returning (using geofencing in the ""smart"" menu), however I am unable to find a way  to schedule switching privacy mode. For example,  I would like to automatically have it switch privacy on at 9am as someone is at home to attend to my dog and I do not wish to record myself or my wife....just my dog when we are not at home or during nightime. As i cant find an option natively in the tapo app, i jsve had to implement this via an alexa routine which works perfectly.Picture quality- given that my camera defaults to low resolution (720p) its what you would expect at this resolution. Clear and crisp enough (on a phone screen, landscape, screen filled) however im only using it as a dog-cam so I cant comment on other applications ( for reading number plates for example). Obviously, as it claims to be a 2k camera, 2k would provide the best quality but I am denied this  pleasure despite having paid for this quality. I feel short changed.There is motion stutter too, even at low resolution.Network issues? Im not sure what issues there can be....the camera is placed in the same room (actually within 2 metres) of my deco wireless mesh hub, which identifies that the camera IS connected wirelessly and it is receiving a FULL STRENGTH SIGNAL....yet the camera constantly reports ""network unstable"" thus preventing the full available resolution, slooooow thumbnail loading and replaying of saved footage...not good.In the deco app I have prioritised the camera and disabled any opportunity of mesh roaming, so I am at a loss as to what the reported ""network unstable"" issue is likely to be.The only other option would be to hard-wire via an ethernet cable in an attempt to eliminate wifi altogether to determine whether it is the wifi or camera is the problem....but as there is no Rzj45 ethernet port on this camera, this option isnt possible... a lesson to be learned  here!.The nework issue persists, so I have  returned this camera and replaced it with one that has ethernet connectivity.This should not be necessary or course as not everyone can easily connect via ethernet, the purpose of choising a wifi camera is of course its location flexibility which is severely limited by using a hard wired cable.",3.0,2024-11-18,United Kingdom 
R269761ZC0X7MC,1st of all the set up is easy . I purchased this after a previous  model I had that worked great with the same quality suddenly kept disconnecting from my WiFi so although it was ok for my needs it annoyingly gave up after around 5 yrs of service so I saw this thinking it would provide the same level of security. & it does to a point .The reason I say to a point it’s due to how this device operates in how it turns to pan left & right  & goes up & down if you want to change its viewing angle . Only the camera what’s centred on the ball at the top that holds the camera in  can go up & down But the top ball area that sits on  the bottom area that the top ball sits on is one solid part & just one whole peice  . My other camera looked exactly the same in shape & style to look at but the ball would turn left & right up & down from floor to ceiling if you wanted it to whilst sat on the lower base area that fans out & looks similar like the ball cam this sits on . I have mine placed on my window sill  but annoyingly I’ve had to mount it screwed down on the base plate it comes with because it only will turn left & right while sat on the  base plate  provided with screws . This is due to the bottom underside of the whole unit the camera has to sit on the  plastic mount plate it comes with for the camera to pan & turn left & right even turning the plug in power cable it’s plugged into  which is strange . . My other ball camera sat above on the lower plastic seating area similar to how this appears & could do a full 360 without  having the whole camera turning even the power cord would be plugged in & that would stay where it was because what the ball camera sat on was just a seat for the top ball camera & just the ball above with the built in camera would spin & do a full 360  sat on the bottom base & this doesn’t . If I’d have known this I wouldn’t have purchased this Tapo camera that’s got all these great reviews. Maybe it’s there 1st time they have owned a ball pan & tilt camera . This I wanted to point outwards of my window to give outside security over my garden area & path & were I park . Due to how this camera turns left & right I have had to mount it on my side wall of my window has I couldn’t have it sat on my windowsill as I’d have to have it elevated on a box like I had my other but due to how it turns left & right I’m unable to do the same . So whilst it covers 95% of my path & garden & car it doesn’t give me 100% now & if I did a full 360 the plug in power cable would move around with it & twist & I’ve had to tack the power cord like I did my other under the underside of my window sill so I don’t have ugly cable hanging down . So if I did decide to turn & look into my bedroom if away like I could my other it would be tugging at the cable I’ve hidden . Also the infra red if pointing outside this gives you glare reflection so it’s impossible to see outside at night so in my other cheaper camera that turned left & right above its base you could switch this off permanently until you needed it if I panned inside to see my bedroom this can do the same by tapping on the viewing screen which bring up the icons day mode & not in the settings were you would think  & this took some finding & I couldn’t find it in the settings it was pure accidental that I tapped onto the picture showing my garden that these icons showed came on the screen & yes it turned off the I.R lights giving me a great view at night through my window pain but come tonight it will auto switch back & turn on the Infra red & if you forget has you have to remember to do it because it cannot be turned into day mode permanently like the better cheaper model I previously owned . Would I recommend Tapo no because of these awful design flaws especially the turning left & right & having to have it seated on a screw down base plate for it to turn left & right plus it won’t turn full upwards to the ceiling if I wanted like my previous cheaper one & having to remember every night to turn it back into day mode to enable you to see out of your window when dark  is impossible to remember to do every night . I don’t recommend this camera as I thought the ball spun on an axis & the bottom was just a seating base like my previous model . My other allowed it to stay on day mode until you changed it back  aswell . Yes the quality is great but most are now now fitted with the same camera quality as this £20 in a deal apparently when I see other reviews from months ago at £20 . Must be on a deal often . . I’ve spent lots of my time writing reviews & sometimes for no reason they get rejected which wastes my time & time I’m unable to get back . Money I can get more of time I can’t so I hope my point in regards my issues with it & are valid & I hope I get notified it’s approved has anything negative seems to get rejected which doesn’t allow other potential buyers the correct pros & cons . 2 ⭐️⭐️ for picture quality which most £20 cams & above now have fitted anyway .,2.0,2024-09-30,United Kingdom 
R199CFC0MDIO09,"I bought this cheap little camera to add to our garage to keep an eye on a new motorbike. For the price, the picture is excellent day and night and there is a lot of functionality to it. The supplied power supply has an abnormally long lead which meant I could position where I wanted, quite a way from the mains socket. I have added in a 64GB card and set a constant recording schedule every night for 8 hours plus motion sensor recording during the day. The camera has roughly 10 days of recording with this schedule allowing time to spot any theft or vandalism and still get the footage. Downloading these files from the camera is easy within the app too. It has an audible motion sensor alarm that you can set a time window on to scare away any would be thieves.  I have attached it to the NVR in the house which also has the same option for an audible motion sensor alarm during a set time plus about 2 months of storage should I need to go back that far. The PTZ is only Pan & Tilt, not Zoom but will track motion if spotted and is practically silent when it does it. I was going to give 4/5 as if you're quick, it gives up tracking and is a little slow to follow. However, for £20 this indoor camera has more functionality than my £50 outdoor cameras and would be ideal for security, baby or pet watching, I therefore feel it warrants the full 5 stars for the price. I did also see functionality for baby crying detection in the software if there are parents reading this review.",5.0,2025-02-27,United Kingdom

Very reasonable for the price, the quality of the image is a little low for 1080p but that's expected given how used to we have gotten to 2k and 4k screens, I think the ideal viewing would be on a smartphone as anything with a big screen won't really give you as much detail.

Night vision as per previous cameras is quite poor, you’d need a better quality camera, specifically for night. The app is straightforward enough and you can move the camera around the room, from the app.What annoys me and lost a star is that after a month, you have to pay to view clips whilst out of the house.

RVVXXJXZTRXTU,We bought this camera to keep an eye on our young dog when left alone in the kitchen at night. We looked into getting a baby monitor first but they were quite expensive this camera is amazing value for money love we can talk through it night vision and so clear connected to my phone. Easily moved around the house.We also have three Tapo outside security cameras which are amazing value for money also.Definitely recommend….,5.0,2025-03-19,United Kingdom

R9BV4NXMGFCLQ,The camera is a good bit of kit simple to use and the set up is almost fully automated with simple audio instructions from the device itself. The app works like a charm and even the least tech savvy person like me should have no problems. If you intend to use it as a security camera indoors or through a window with memory card no need for cloud storage it has excellent definition and night mode is very good with good quality imaging and refresh rate up to 30 yards easily.However we bought this and another as baby monitors and unfortunately they are pretty much useless in this capacity as the live stream to mobile devices times out after a maximum of 5 minutes. It asks if you want to continue and you must click to do so. If you have a memory card inserted it will continue to record but your live feed is stopped.This was disappointing and after following and applying ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS in the troubleshooting guide I was unable to make either the TC60 or TC70 function adequately as a baby monitor and have had to return them both.I am however intending to purchase a couple of Tapo external security cameras as for the price they seem be an excellent product if used as a security device.,3.0,2025-01-25,United Kingdom

R3GASF59X42A65,"Good quality, when connection is strong; Annoyingly, it seems that any clips saved or downloaded have the TAPO watermark, despite paying for the premium but that might be industry standard, I'm not entirely familiar. On that note however, the premium is affordable although I didn't see this caveat advertised anywhere which was a bit misleading, I rather this be up-front, but it is only about £4 a month for 30-Days Cloud Storage, Automatic Clipping, etc.I use mine as a nanny cam for my kitten, the mic quality isn't great and it startles him when I try to speak to him through as it's a bit loud (so test it before you use it when your pets alone) it so I would be wary if you are buying this for your cat or dog that is home alone and maybe suffers seperation anxiety.The app is quite good, fairly user friendly and quick to get the hang of.I would prefer if the view angle was capable of looking down just a tad more since you know, small cat, and cameras typically go up high, but it's livable.It looks alright, feels a bit flimsy plastic wise but I'm just a tech nerd so to most, it's probably fine! It can be a bit reluctant to turn and has low sensitivity for adjusting the angle but again, completely livable and to be expected considering the price!Would recommend for anyone needing pet cameras or bulk security cams!",4.0,2024-12-06,United Kingdom

I understand that cloud storage has a cost and, if I wanted it, I would pay for it.  But, features such as continual tracking after motion detection, baby crying etc do NOT require cloud storage and can be managed on the local SD card without cloud storage.  I suspect more and more features will become 'premium' features with time that you can only accessvia a monthly subscription.

I had the product up and running quickly, and it is now positioned high up on my wall in the utility room which is fairly large, and this gives me a great view of all the room and what my dogs are up to. The night vision is also excellent and very clear. I double it up with a baby monitor to pick up the sound without having to use my 'phone, and then check on my 'phone to see what the puppy is up to.

R3QNWV89HUDMRS,"I bought this camera just to see how they worked as I wanted to remotely monitor a property we own. So far I have been pleasantly surprised. Though I realise it's not an outdoors-rated camera, I mounted it outside on a well-sheltered balcony from where I could monitor our garden. Eventually I will get one or more outdoors models and this one can be used indoors elsewhere (probably monitoring the pantry, where it also does a good job catching ""criminals"" pilfering biscuits).Set-up was easy, and what surprised me was that the feed from the camera was accessible through the app without needing to share ports on the router or anything like that, so I guess it's being routed via the manufacturer's servers in some way. On the downside, you can only access the camera through the phone app, there is no desktop app, which is kind of a disappointment as I spend a lot of my time at my PC and don't like having to fire up an app every time. I think if you pay for the service then you can probably see the feeds in a browser via your TP-LINK cloud account, but I don't want to do that at this time. The only other way is a direct IP connection to the camera but that's not possible with a lot of ISPs these days (mine included).It's almost like magic being able to pan this remote camera around and see what's going on at our property in real-time. On the other hand some of the other features are less useful. The motion-detection is rather trigger-happy even on the lowest setting so you will get a lot of recordings (on the SD card, unless you pay for the cloud service, again) of just branches moving in the wind. The microphone and speaker are very low quality and pretty unusable, you can't really make out what is being said in either direction. Maybe if the speaker stands right by the camera. Also, the camera quality isn't REALLY that great. I can barely distinguish whether it's raining or not, for example, especially at night - though otherwise the night vision is surprisingly good.I'm just not expecting too much for under 30 quid, so actually this camera exceeded expectations, and I will probably buy other cameras from the Tapo ecosystem in the future to complement it, especially as you can easily add dozens more cameras and view them all via the single app. If I end up not doing so, the main deal-killer will probably be the lack of a desktop app.",5.0,2024-05-22,United Kingdom

And plug it in where you want it. And that's it. You can pay for cloud storage if you want but no need to.You'll be amazed at the functionality in the app.  Pan/tilt, and it can recognise people, great in the dark, motion sensor works and can store automatically to the card. You can view the card data and download videos to your phone. And you can put your voice over it! and it has sound on the videos. You can also set it to private when you are home and reset that to away to record. The camera actually follows you as you walk by it.Can't believe this little gem does all that. And the picture quality is good.I just bought it to look at my plants while away so I know when to ask my neighbour to come by to water them!The app also lets you access any tlink devices you might have.

I dont expect a  premium feel from this prive point.The Image quality is actually good again for the price.The ptz control works fine althouth its a bit slow, dont expect image quality to be great whilst the camera is moving as it blocks up a bit, but this effects most cameras with ptz. It also has a patrol mode that when set the camera will patrol side side.Motion detection works ok, its not the best but it works you can change the sensitivity and what type of motion is detected (Motion, person and tamper) it also has a baby cry setting which will be a useful feature if your using as a baby monitor.Setup is easy with the tapo app, i cant see anyone going wrong setting it up.It does have rtsp and onvif capabilities but this has to be enabled (i use with blue iris software and it works fine)All in all for a budget camera that just works with quite a few features its great value for money.Hope you found this helpful, thanks :)",5.0,2024-10-20,United Kingdom

RYEN1O5PZ0S85,"Upgraded after having Fire 7 for several years. Was half price on Prime Day so got my husband to get it me for Xmas. Love the device, but Amazon Shopping app doesn’t work at all on it, just flicks straight back to Home Screen, ( on googling/looking on forums, this seems to be a common issue with no answer!) and both Amazon video and App Store tiles don’t show, just has the name underneath but if you tap in the blank space it does take you to the app. Nice size to see everything but still comfy to hold. Can use Alexa to do many things on it easily. Holds charge really well so far. I’m glad I got it.",4.0,2024-12-31,United Kingdom 
R2JKGP602KNBK,"I reluctantly traded in my 10 year old(!) Fire HDX to take advantage of a £50 Black Friday deal on this newest gen tablet. Apps kept failing on the HDX (of course; it was a dinosaur), but the ads had also long since disappeared :) and I was still able to use it as a Kindle, to play games, music, browse websites, and watch Netflix and Freevee, AND it still held a charge well! It was time to let it go, but I will really miss it.Why? Because the screen/picture quality of the HDXs of yesteryear were totally unrivalled at that price point, and Amazon has never made a tablet of equal quality again.The inferior display of this new HD8 is therefore quite jarring, but I will get used to it.Possibly related, or just as a result of advances in tech, it is thinner and lighter too, which is particularly nice if you want portability. The colour options are also attractive.The interface is fine, the settings all customisable, and the charge lasts forever. The lock screen ads aren't intrusive at all. You can disable Alexa voice commands if you wish, but it's there for those who want it.The best thing about Amazon tablets is the option to link them to your account at the point of purchase, so right out of the box, all your books etc are ready and waiting for you. Unfortunately I did find that my ""Actually Free"" apps (remember those?!) were absent and I'd have to buy them again, which was a shame, but to be expected I guess.The Silk browser still isn't the best, and has no ad blocker to my knowledge, so it didn't take long to decide I'd have to download an APK for a better browser + ad blocker, which is very easy to do. I don't feel the need to jailbreak further like some reviews suggest, as the selection of apps available from Amazon is more than enough for me.It is exceptionally good value at the deal price if you already use Amazon for books, music, TV, Alexa controlled devices, and so on - otherwise you might be a little disappointed at its limitations. But for those individuals and families who cannot afford or justify the obscene cost of the latest tablet from other big brands, it's a really fantastic option. I just wonder if it will last as long as the HDX....",4.0,2024-12-26,United Kingdom 
ROWJP5ZJ7KJ6F,"I have never owned a Kindle etc. And I am a complete tech dinosaur. I bought this because unfortunately my mum took a full, broke her hip and found herself in hospital having surgery. She's just about to enter week 3.She is a side room on her own but there are no TVs etc. And the signal is really poor on a standard digital radio So I started to think about audiobooks etc. And began and began scrolling and I have to be completely honest. It was the price that won me over and the reviewsI need you something that was going to be simple because my mum turned 90 this year but she's certainly of sound mind etc. She's just got wobbly hoofs from time to timeI ordered it at 10:00 p.m. as it arrived at 10:00 a.m. just before I left for the hospital ... Perfect and promptly left when I opened it something didn't seem quite right. I'm not sure if they're supposed to have a booklet with them or anything. I am a complete tech dinosaur but I can't open it because The screen's locked and the pin number is required ???? Obviously I flied a few different numbers and failed. I now have an option other than to do a factory reset and start again now I've got other issues so I'm going to return it My mum says she doesn't want it so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I feel it could be something really handy to have but I have been a bit put off by events tonight but if any man can advise me as to how to set it up That would be great.

RVXFT9EYP7GRH,"I previously owned an earlier version of the Fire 8 tablet, which had slowed down, was very well worn and really needed replacing. I only use it for browsing, reading and a bit of online shopping, so I don't need anything other than a very basic tablet, which this is but for my needs it's ideal, especially as I used trade in option with a limited time offer which made the cost only £35. (not sure I would want to pay the full price as the Amazon operating system has definite limitations on app availability unless you're comfortable sideloading Google Play).It's not lightening fast, for the price I wouldn't expect it to be-but it's absolutely fine for browsing etc. and definitely better than my previous tablet. It wouldn't be suitable for someone who wants something to multi task or play games, but for the price I paid, I don't think there's anything comparable. It's lightweight and the size makes it easy to hold and stick in a bag or pocket.Be aware that if you want it for things like online banking, for example, you won't find the necessary apps in Amazon's own app store, so check before buying if particular apps are necessary to you.",4.0,2025-01-06,United Kingdom 
R289J5HSOTCSQ9,"I bought this because an Amazon customer support agent advised me that my existing tablet was faulty after my shop Amazon & Amazon photo apps stopped working as expected & switched to functionality via the Silk browser.Just before this arrived (same day), my partner's Fire tablet developed the same 'fault'. Nevertheless, the Fire tablet I already had (10th Gen) was faulty from new - it managed to corrupt at least 5 micro SD cards before I gave up using one (same SD card that my partner has used long -term without issue); so I decided to give the new arrival a try.The first thing I noted (with some alarm) is the distinct lack of privacy & control on this model. On the 10th Gen, we'd both disabled Alexa & location services, and limited camera/microphone usage & file access to only the apps that really needed them. I couldn't do that on this (12th Gen).As I went through permissions for the pre-installed apps, I continually encountered messages saying that a variety of them need permissions (that they actually don't), & an inability to remove/disable permissions that I didn't want some apps to have. I encountered no such issues with the 10th Gen.Next, I updated it. It seemed fully updated until the following morning, when it showed several new updates. I went through those updates, & it suddenly had the same 'fault ' my original tablet had been diagnosed with - Amazon shop & photos working via the Silk browser, with Amazon shop displaying the classical web page view (fiddly to view & use well on an 8"" device).As you may have guessed by now (with 3 tablets all having the same 'fault'), there was never a fault at all - Amazon's software engineers seem to have a grudge against their employer, so have decided in their wisdom to shoot Amazon (& themselves) in the foot by rendering Fire tablets unfit for purpose. Access to the shop & uploaded photos is now via the Silk browser instead of direct apps (as a customer service agent confirmed today).As anyone that's ever used a Fire tablet knows, Amazon's app store is very limited. There are no decent security/antivirus apps available. Not only do you get full web view on a tiny device, you get it via a web browser that you can't protect.For me, the entire purpose of having a Fire tablet at all was the Shop Amazon app (with easy app view & presumably some in-built security), & easy access/auto uploading of photos in one app - both now gone by design. Photos are now stored on the tablet in a 'Gallery' app on the device, & you have to go into the separate photo app to upload any of them to Amazon Photos/the cloud.The convenience of auto-connect by registered device is gone too. If like me, you regularly clear your browser history, then after doing so, you'll need to sign in with your password to access your Amazon account or uploaded photos (for me, that's almost every time) - on an unsecured device.I have a larger android tablet. It's protected by Norton 360 (unavailable in Amazon's app store). If I've got to have web connection to some Amazon services anyway, I'll use that to connect. A variety of Amazon apps can be downloaded onto standard android tablets too (android has caught up with Amazon, but Amazon hasn't caught up with it).Given the (reportedly intended & permanent) software changes and lack of user control & privacy on the 12th Gen (it's a bit pointless disabling Alexa if Amazon has the capability to spy on your every move regardless), I'd strongly recommend getting a standard android device instead that you can protect with a good security program.",2.0,2024-12-16,United Kingdom

R1FQX689EBO9M7,"Any advantages I might have gained with this new 12th gen HD8 (64 gb) compared to my previous (10th gen) HD8 have been wiped out by the one big problem I’ve had. Which is: since I first turned it on I’ve been getting several false wakes every day - including several today - and this has worried me significantly. I went to the Alexa app and reviewed what the device had actually recorded and can confirm that what I’d said to trigger the recording was nothing like my wake word. In short: it’s turning on the mic and recording me pretty much randomly several times a day.Edit: Amazon reached out to me a few days after I posted the original review. The problem appears to have been solved by resetting the tablet to the factory settings and starting again from the beginning. When I did this I noted that the Alexa app updated and this may have helped resolve the issue. I only seem to have one wake word now instead of the choice, previously, but I can live with that. Many thanks to the Amazon representative who phoned me and who was kind, polite, and helpful.I’ve revised my overall rating accordingly. The tablet seems reasonably fast and responsive and I like using it. And no false wakes since the reset. Fingers crossed it stays like that.",4.0,2024-10-10,United Kingdom

It does this job brilliantly, I can see all my recipes in glorious colour, it’s just like having a colour Kindle.But then there’s everything else it does too, that a Kindle can’t do - there’s video, there’s web browsing, music, email, games, streaming platforms like Prime, Netflix, Paramount, Sky/NOW TV, BBC iPlayer and so on, audiobooks, Alexa, even photo tools. I have Word, Excel, MS Notes and Outlook on there too. Okay so the app range is quite limited compared to an iPad or Android tablet, but it has all the standard stuff most people use in their average week.For a very low cost tablet, the Fire 8 is unbelievable good value when in a Sale. It’s cheaper than a black and white Kindle and does far more stuff. Compared to the colour Kindle, it’s an absolute steal.Even though I own an iPad Pro, I still use this in preference when I’m reading books or cooking and need the recipe easily available.

R24KFJWCV5GQTM,"Bought this to replace an old Samsung Gear S3 after Samsung stopped supporting it with updates. I was sad to see the Gear go as it had served me well.Having said that, I love this new Huawei watch. I had never considered them as a brand but took a chance after doing some research. The things I love most about it are:- It's a good looking watch. The face of watch is big yet sleek, and the number dial on the outside frames the screen beautifully (in my humble opinion.) The big watch face also makes it easy to read.- The watch settings seem easy to navigate. I haven't had much trouble finding what I need.- The battery life is great. This watch arrived 10 days ago. I started using it on day one, and it's still at 40% charge. Admittedly I don't try and use all the bells and whistles, so other users may see it drain more quickly depending on usage. But even if it did, I'm haply because my Samsung needed to be charged sometimes twice a day.- Functionally, it's what I need: it tells time, tracks steps, vibrates when someone is calling, and seems to be good quality from a reputable brand.Tldr: Looks good, good battery life, good quality and provides key functions I want.I will definitely be wearing this until they stop supporting it. Id recommend this for anyone who wants a smart watch that just kind of does the basic things you want a smart watch to do.",5.0,2024-08-25,United Kingdom 
RNBFZBOIB1T6C,"I’ve had a while with this watch & time to compare it side by side with Apple Watch SE 2nd gen.All watches are poor at sleep, certainly the type of sleep if not duration. My previous Huawei gt2e was very good on duration, naps & short wake times. This one is not as accurate. It told me I slept, while in reality I had woken and propped myself in bed on my phone. However it’s very newly released so software updates will come.It has been used on several walks & exercise in conjunction with the Apple SE. Both give almost identical results on all metrics. Given the health data too, I’d conclude Huawei are only fractionally less accurate than Apple. But with incredibly battery life. All health data on, GPS used, weather on & its giving at least 10 days before reaching 20% battery.It’s light, very strong feeling, beautiful bright screen and very comfortable to wear & sleep in. I don’t need apps & internet draining my battery, I have a phone. I need health & exercise tracking accuracy, and good battery.I think it’s nearly perfect for those looking for good build, good looks, accurate tracking, sleek modern UI & excellent battery stamina. The app is on iOS so Apple deems it safe & secure. It’s clear, user friendly and information rich. A vast collection of free watch faces are available too.I like both watches but Apple’s battery life is woeful & charging so often is a chore. Especially when you get so long & speedy recharging with Huawei.EditAn update has improved the sleep tracking & it’s now very accurate.",4.0,2023-10-18,United Kingdom

R1Z8QVB5GHRQZ4,"On the whole, there's more to like than not about this watch.The face is clear and bright. The screen is the size of a typical watch face, there's barely any bevel around the edge. It comes with several faces installed, but others can be added (mostly at a cost, but the one I use was just 49p, which is hardly breaking the bank).The interface is easy to use, though I've switched to a list of options rather than just icons, because just icons is too much guesswork.The Find My Phone option is great. I'm forever putting my phone down and forgetting where. I have my ringer turned off and just vibrate, making it hard to find by calling. The option on the watch cranks up the volume on the phone so loud that most of the street must know you're looking for it.It charges quickly (I've not really paid attention to just how long). My last watch, a Garmin, required a cable plugging in and sometimes wouldn't charge because the contacts got dirty (I guess sweat, dead skin, whatever). However, with the Huawei, it just sits on the charger, no worries about it cables and dirty contacts.I've done workouts with my old Garmin on one wrist, this on the other, and in terms of HR, calories burnt, etc, they give similar results.It has many different exercises it can track, but thus far I've only used the same one over and over.Battery life, tracking a couple of workouts a week, nice bright screen, etc, lasts a couple of weeks.Notifications from my phone come up with a lot of preview visible on the screen. Calls also come through, but I've some figuring out to do there - I took one while I had earphones connected, but the sound didn't come through them; I think it tried to use the watch's speaker and mic. I'm sure this might be handy in some circumstances, but it really wasn't ideal when I just wanted to accept the call.The downside - not a huge one - it's fast it's Huawei and the US didn't want to compete with China, so banned their phone tech. Thus, it's incompatible with Google and can't be used for contactless payment, even though the facility is built in.Also, it uses something called Petal Maps (I guess instead of the ubiquitous Google Maps). This is a total bust. If you select the Petal Maps on the watch, it presents you with a QR code to download the app onto your phone. I then get a message on the phone saying that it cannot be installed because the app is too old for the version of Android on my phone (a 2023 Motorola, running Android 14). The GT4 was released in September 2023, so you'd expect that two pieces of 2023 hardware would work better together and this problem with Petal Maps shouldn't exist.Finally, I'll be shopping for a new wristband. The one it came with barely fastens around my wrist and I wouldn't say I've got the biggest wrists. The strap is much smaller in length - and narrower - than any strap I had for my Garmin. It's kinda weird, given they have similar sized faces.",4.0,2025-01-02,United Kingdom

The screen looks large and clear, without looking too big on the wrist.Set up could not have been more straightforward, and as the watch came with a partial charge, from opening the box to wearing the watch fully synced to my Iphone14 pro phone took about 30 minutes. I took longer to select a watch face from the numerous free options available on the Huawei Health App  downloaded from Apple App Store.I haven’t normally worn a watch whilst sleeping but this is so comfortable on the wrist it’s well worth doing for the sleep data it collects.The screen size and clarity mean notifications are very easy to read, with text messages, Whats App messages popping up without any delay from my phone.It has received incoming calls without any issues and the sound quality is really impressive, even outdoors.The fitness and exercise trackers are all incredibly accurate when compared to otherGPS and exercise products I have used.It doesn’t have the versatility of the Apple Watch with limited IOS access but the inbuilt apps on the GT4 cover virtually all my needs.

I would recommend staying with the custom watch face that it comes with as it looks great. One thing I don't like about the default watch face though is that I can't see the battery level, but not a big deal.I use my watch to track my training and fitness and it's good. The range of measurements are great. I haven't used it to track running yet, mostly for HIIT training. One thing that bugs me about the design of this watch and the GTPro2 is that on exercises where you are lifting kettle bells for example, the equipment can press off the side of the watch and it can pause the tracking of your training. I think that the main watch button should match the secondary flat button below to avoid this.All other functions are great, love these watches. Really comfortable and looks amazing.",5.0,2024-04-19,United Kingdom 
R1H2UF7GYDXI1R,So I’ve only just got this 1/6/24 but it seems very good for £199. It paired up with my phone very easily using the watches app. Lovely looking watch. No end of watch faces to choose from so you can change it whenever and as many times as you want. The screen is crisp and big enough to be very functional. Great health features on the watch and when used in conjunction with the app it really enhances those features. Feels good on the wrist and is a nice weight and size. The only thing I’d like that I think is missing is the ability to change the date format. I’ve looked but there doesn’t seem to be that option. So overall if the battery is as good as it claims to be and it doesn’t develop any issues I’ll be very pleased with the watch. 👍🏼,5.0,2024-06-01,United Kingdom

RWPCSBO1U33YG,"I have an iphone and have always used the same branded smartwatch for years. This Huawei watch however seems far superior to me and I think I have been converted. The watch face itself is really stylish alongside the leather strap. I do wish it also came with a bit more of an active band for when you're working out, but this watch looks so good on, very attractive for everyday use.The battery life of this is excellent compared to others and makes a huge difference. The functionality doesn't allow you to reply to messages directly on the watch but I never use this anyway as it is much easier to type on your phone, but still gives you the regular notifications to have a preview which is useful.It has more tracking which is really nice, the sleep tracking seems accurate and I like that it tracks stress and temperature as well, alongside the normal heart rate and blood oxygen levels. The Huawei app is great as well as you can track any noises in your sleep too and is more detailed than other fitness watches/apps I've  used.Overall very impressed with this and seems like excellent value for money.",5.0,2023-11-04,United Kingdom

R1C8WF8QASY6LW,I can't speak highly enough about my GT4. This is light years the best smart watch I have ever worn and met every expectation and then some. OK I have never owned or worn an apple watch and do realise that comparisons could vary but what I do know is the GT4 battery lasts me 2 weeks with full usage whereas the apple watch needs to be charged almost daily so for me there is no comparison. I use my Huawei GT4 watch paired to my work IPhone and it works like an absolute dream and have zero complaints. All functions and vitals are on point and extremely user friendly. I ordered various straps for different occasions and love them. You will not be disappointed with this watch!!!,5.0,2024-04-08,United Kingdom

R3A602UNQ5XOHK,"With the old vacuum cleaner packing up after a long stint we searched for a new one. Having had Vax and Dyson before we started there, but then came across the reviews for this one.I remember one person saying it hoovered better than anything they had before and they were right.Used this for the first time yesterday and it honestly made it look like we had never hoovered the floor before given what it picked up. Not that it had only been done two days prior.Edge to edge suction and various settings mean it easily works across all floors. (Just be careful as I did loose a couple of the small toys that the kids leave lying around into the hoover as the suction was that good) The results were amazing.  Only minor thing I would have liked is a longer cord as it would have been beneficial to us in our house.It was also easy to put together and has a 5 year guarantee. What’s not to love about that? Definitely worth it for the price.Definitely pleased with my purchase and given my mid life age, what a treat this was. Does life get any better haha.",5.0,2025-03-04,United Kingdom 
R36NRWQ4FDCYX7,"I had high expectations of this machine and it has not disappointed at all. It arrived so quickly and it was beautifully packaged with great care by Shark. Not a single scratch on it. Very easy to set up and super easy to use. Cannot fault the ease of use at all and unlike some other comments about the cord getting in the way, I found the little side hook holds the cord well enough put of the way during use. I used to have an expensive Dyson Animal Ball 2 vacuum that was very good but I feel this Shark is better for ease of use because it's motorised. My back is not very good anymore so I knew the Dyson was no longer a good choice. This Shark also has just as good an air filtration system as the Dyson in that the air smells so lovely and clean after using it. This outcome actually did exceed my expectations a lot because I didn't anticipate another brand could compare to Dyson's Air filtration. The only thing I can say the Dyson outperforms this Shark in is the motorised attachment tool - the Animal Ball Dyson's one does not have a spindle that gets tangled with human hair which is one of their special design features whereas the one on the Shark does. However, I knew this would be the case because no vacuum by any manufacturer can adequately deal with the level of shedding my head of hair produces. However, this is only to do with this specific attachment. In terms of the actual main vacuum's ability cope with my shedding, I've found this Shark far out performs the Dyson. The Shark has left not a single strand of hair behind that I can see. However, I know that I need to gently cut the wrapped hair off the Shark's spindle every time and I'm happy to do that one minute job for the sake of the fantastic overall performance. Interestingly, Shark have designed a little groove along both the main motorised head spindle and also the one of the attachment where your scissor blade can scooch along safely as you cut. Genius! Also a win for this Shark is the operation lights at the front. Game changer for finding the dirt. Another huge plus is how quiet this vacuum is. Fabulous, fabulous machine. 100% happy I bought it.",5.0,2025-02-22,United Kingdom

R1UEDN4QS8Y1JW,"Needed a new vacuum.  Saw this on special, did a little research and clicked that button.Easy to put together.  Fairly lightweight, and you can detach the motor and carry around one handed to get to those awkward places, like curtains and underneath grandma.Suction power is great, with two settings for hard floors and carpets.  First use made the carpet in the living room look like new - and yes, I should vacuum more often.The pet cleaning tool isn't just a gimmick either.  Tried it out on some cushions etc, removed all cat hairs etc very efficiently.Tried it on the cat, but she called her lawyer.  Oh well..Floor unit part works fine too.  Had two reasonably powerful LED lights, so you can see under things and remind yourself why you need to vacuum more.What else?Emptying it is easy peasy, lemon squeezy.  The only thing I could criticise, is that the actual dust/cat hair/old toenails collection receptacle is a tad small.  Lots of trips out to the garbage bin, but, its easy to empty, with a trapdoor mechanism so you don't even need to stick your hand in among the unmentionables to empty it out.The suction is a might powerful to be used on small rugs, as I found out, among various Laurel & Hardy scenes of me waving the wand end about with a rug attached, yelling ""Stop! Damn you! STOP!""We live and learn, and that's not really a complain about Le Shark.That's it.  Very good vacuum.

With this Shark vacuum, firstly, the LED lights meant not only could I see all that debris better, I could see just how much better it was at clearing it. What took me an hour with the Henry took maybe 10 minutes with this Shark vacuum, and with much better results to boot. When I had finished using it that first day, I was almost annoyed as I wanted to keep using it and seeing how impressive it was. This machine has saved literal hours of my life.It feels like a lot of thought has gone into this vacuum, with the accessories, parts support, ability to take the bottom roller off for easy carrying on stairs, and of course the genius idea of the front LED.I liked it so much, a month later I bought a Shark EX200UK Carpet Cleaner, and I was even more impressed with that!",5.0,2024-12-29,United Kingdom

R15OMX9IV5OE9L,"I bought my first Shark hoover back in 2019 and the quality was amazing. Received this hoover this morning and the first thing I noticed is that it feels cheap and tacky. Gave the living room a good hoover, and it does the job amazingly well, not disappointed with that at all. It has great power, and really lifts the dirt out of the rugs.The cons for me, you now only have a min/max switch for suction power. This used to be a slider so you could adjust to get the right amount of suction.The liftaway now lifts the whole pod and pipes away from the base, it used to just lift the pod away so the pipe and base were left attached together and thin enough to get under furniture. This is a real negative for me (see photos)The on/off switch feels cheap and tacky, and this now has off-hard floor-carpet feature rather than a separate switch for floor type.The hose feels cheap, I have a feeling it won't be long before this splits.The attachments aren't great, and again different to the last ones. Hopefully the old ones will fit this newer model (haven't tried them yet) They do however tell you on the box that you can purchase these 'better' attachments separately!The felt and foam filters are cheap and nasty looking! After using the hoover only once, the foam is full of dust and dirt already, especially building up in the corners (see photos) There's also dust on the outside of the canister around the base. Not sure why this is happening or if it's even supposed to, but this shows that it's not capturing all the dirt inside the hoover, and some of it is being blasted back out!Overall I'm disappointed with the changes made to the newer model, however it still does what it's supposed to and it does it with ease! Being the owner of a long haired German Shepherd I need a hoover that can really work hard and get that fur out of the rugs, and it does it really well (along with all the dirt and grime that settles deep down into the fibres of the rugs and carpets too)All that remains is too see if this Shark will stand the test of time like the old one.",4.0,2024-12-06,United Kingdom

It’s versatile and I love how you can take the container off the bottom bit to be able to do the stairs easily. The little pet hair tool makes doing the stairs a doddle as it easily picks up dog hair. Neither rotation tool seems to get clogged up with dog hair either. But I have a couple of grips, the container which holds the dust/dog hair is not big enough, so I’m emptying it very frequently. The other issue I have is if you are using the hose the vacuum has a tendency to topple over, which I find annoying.

It was easy to assemble,  good instructions and very easy to use! It gets under things i could get under with my old cleaner, love the headlights which pick out all the bits!! My carpets have had a new lease of life, feeling like new again and the amount of dust and fluff that comes out of them every time I clean up is amazing! OK, the receptical is a tad on the small side but I ensure I empty it after every clean as I like to see how much it picks up each time! It's really easy to empty too.

After moving into a new home, I decided to put it to the test on the fresh carpet. I was surprised by how much dust and debris it picked up – it exceeded my expectations.One feature I really like is the transparent container, which lets you see exactly what it’s collecting. To really test it, I scattered some lentils on the carpet, and it picked up almost every single one, which was impressive.That said, there are a couple of minor downsides. The cable tends to get in the way while vacuuming, which can be a bit annoying.Overall, though, I’m very satisfied with its performance, and I feel like I’ve definitely gotten good value for my money as it does for what I need.

R2MP29VACXNXRK,"I had a similar Shark cleaner some years ago, but it didn’t have the lift away functionality.  I have a mix of porcelain tiles and carpet and need a long nozzle to clean cobwebs, skirting boards, carpet edges etc.  I have another upright cleaner but it’s a real fiddle to switch from nozzle cleaning to ordinary cleaning and involves adding tubes, fiddling with clips etc.The beauty of Shark is that they’ve put a lot of thought into making adding or removing attachments very simple.  Mostly it’s one click and good to go.  As I have grip and strength issues with my hands, this is important; I want to make the job as easy as possible not have to spend ages messing with the machine.The lift away section is superb.  It’s comfortable to hold, it doesn’t fall over easily and it’s not too heavy.  Adding a metal extension pole to the concertina hose section is simple and means you can vacuum skirtings etc without bending.  I’ve carried it around with ease. The container is a decent size, so debris doesn’t have to be emptied every few minutes.  It takes seconds to restore it to a standard upright and moving from one surface to another is just a simple click of a switch.  The suction power is superb.  I was surprised at how much dust has come up from the carpets, so I guess it’s better than the Vax I’ve been using for some 6 months.  Emptying the canister is easy; just press a button to release fro the machine, the press open the base of the canister and all the debris falls out into the bin.  The anti wrap technology works well and it really picks up cat and dog hairs from the carpet.  The lights are powerful and useful in dingy corners.Overall, this feels a little more plasticky than the model I had about 5 years ago, but it’s robust and well made and cones with a 5 year warranty.  The upholstery and pet hair tools are excellent.  Simple to attach and remove and make vacuuming sofas and mattresses a bit of a doddle.  Much, much easier than using a standard upright.  In a nutshell, I can’t fault this appliance. I’ve had a Dyson in the past and I think this is not only better, it’s significantly less expensive.  I nearly bought the corded stick version and I’m pleased I changed my mind and decided to try the slightly larger lift away.  It’s much better all round.  Very, very happy to recommend.",5.0,2024-03-13,United Kingdom

R26TXKZ11SUKQH,"The first thing I noticed was that the suction on this Shark vacuum cleaner was really strong, so much so that it felt heavy to move.  There is an adjustable setting so that it doesn't suck as much, but I was thinking that this would mean that it wouldn't pick up as much, but that didn't seem to be the case.  I did find myself constantly adjusting the suction and the one for hard floors or carpets.When you put it in the upright position the rollers stop moving, which is the only thing I don't like about it as I like to use that position for vacuuming the stairs.It is very easy to lift off the stick to make is easy to get into the edges and 2 of the 3 included attachments have places on board, I'm not sure why there is no place for the 3rd piece.My old vac is an 8 year old Oreck, and I was happy with it for years, but just lately it hasn't been picking up as well as it used to do.  This Shark picked up a lot of stuff off my carpets and my carpets still look clean 5 days later, something that hasn't happened with my Oreck for a while now.It was easy to empty straight into the bin, and it doesn't require bags, so no additional expense until you need repair parts; hopefully that will be years in the future.I'm going to have to figure out how to best vac my stairs, but the fact that my carpets have remained clean for so long with 3 of us and a moulting cat walking all over them is enough to make me want to do that.If this Shark lasts 8 years, like my Oreck did, then I will definitely be looking to get another Shark next time, and will try to find one where the rollers don't stop when it is in the upright position.  I'm not sure why they think that is a good feature, it isn't as far as I'm concerned!  Maybe they could have a switch for that, too, for those of us who don't like that feature.",5.0,2024-05-18,United Kingdom

RK0LET21MHN86,"Very happy with the product. I had never used a fancy vacuum cleaner like this one, having only used classical ones in the past (e.g., Henry or similar).I had to find a vacuum cleaner that would fit behind the door in my room due to space constraints. Being detachable, I'm storing the base part separately and the upright part behind the door, so the door can open properly. This way, I have it easily accessible as well. Just grab the two pieces, put them together in one click, and vacuum. In a maximum of 5 minutes, I'm done cleaning the carpet in my room.It has strong suction, and the rotating brush is brilliant. It's light enough for me to maneuver easily. It is also very versatile and can be used in many setups, reaching into my drawers and not easily accessible corners and spots. It is just perfect. I never knew how practical these vacuum cleaners are.I don't have pets, but the pet attachment is very useful, having a smaller rotating brush to fit tight spaces or stairs. Although the vacuum cleaner itself is not too noisy, the pet attachment is, due to the whistle effect, but it is not a major issue. All the other attachments are good and practical.The cord is quite long, reaching all areas of my room and all the floor's staircase without having to switch outlets, which is very convenient. The dust container is easy to empty, not requiring a bag or other consumables. It has a sponge separator between the container and the motor that is quite impractical to clean as it retains a huge amount of dust, but it's not necessarily an issue. I'll probably use a rubbish liner to dust that inside next time. It's unreal the amount of dust it collects in the container; I don't know where it all comes from. It has some LED lights that might be useful; however, I can't say they helped me too much, but they are there.I haven't tried the vacuum too much on hard floors, just a little bit, but from what I've tried, it performs very well. I've used it mostly on carpet, and it's brilliant. It has separate switch positions for hard floors and carpet. Maintenance is straightforward, aside from the aforementioned sponge separator.Based on my experience with this Shark vacuum cleaner so far, I'm very satisfied.",5.0,2024-06-26,United Kingdom

R118GJIVCY1KKP,After 4 years of owning this vac here’s an honest opinion. Very cheap and poor design flaws otherwise it’s ok and that’s it. The single wheel design makes it fall over very easily and then because it’s falls over it breaks. The lift away part  is very difficult to engage when trying to put back. The brush head gets clogged very easily if you have pets or long hair humans so it needs checking regularly.On plus side the attachments are good and lift away part is useful when you clean a car (get car kit).Bangles part is good as it splits items into a compartment for large items and dust below. Filters need replacement every few months but can be washed and dried.We had from a bagged Miele before and quality is chalk and cheese and they aren’t far apart in price for either and my recommendation would be the Miele.

It certainly gets in the way when hoovering a bedroom.

R2MHHF004A8THC,"Boy oh boy does this do the business and no mistake!Willie Nelson talked about sucking the chrome off of a trailer hitch in a movie - possibly part of the Star Wars/Seka franchise crossover - and this lives up to the hype.I have ended up getting through several packets of carpet tacks and underlay glue as this demon of a device will easily lift any poorly fitted carpet right off the floor.I have lost several items of clothing from under the bed, as well as a sock that I was wearing at the time of doing my domestic chores.This thing has even had a slipper that wasn't nailed down!Added to that it's 'corded' which is even more brilliant.Once I plug it into one of my electric outlets within the domicile the run time is endless.No need to recharge it or change those really awkward fiddly batteries - it just keeps going on what I believe is called 'mains'.It's got more lights and gadgets than that spaceship in that movie - again part of the Star Wars/Seka franchise - I think it was the Millennium something or other - anyway the one that shoots planets.More lights than that so I can even hoover in the dark.I bet you could clean up a major crime scene and nobody from NCIS would find a trace of DNA.I'm talking serious suction - I even use it for interior decorating as it strips wallpaper off the walls and takes plaster down to the brickwork.Fantastic piece of kit - Seka would be proud.",5.0,2024-07-27,United Kingdom

R2N1JIJ9VVIPOD,"I purchased because of the reviews and the price, plus I wanted a solid hoover that was going to last. This is a heavy one so I don’t think it’s for the faint hearted, it is a workout in itself and is loud!I love the fact that it sucks everything up through the carpet not like a normal hoover, this is very strong and I couldn’t believe how dirty my carpets were, I thought they were clean with my old one-wrong!  I previously had Hetty but it was too bulky to drag around.I recommend this Shark brand because they are known for long lasting products, believe me your carpets won’t know what’s hit them!",5.0,2024-12-04,United Kingdom 
R34QPN911COP86,"Finding it hard to determine if this is a good vacuum or not.You can not deny it is exceptionally powerful, and lightweight. But other than that, I'm failing to see where it would be useful.On long/deep pile carpet, it takes serious effort (and I'm fit) and if exceptionally deep pile - it will tear it to shreds, as we found out on a £600 rug.On short pile it tends to ""hop/skip"" along the floor, presumably because the brush is constantly in contact with the floor.Bizarrely, you can not disengage the drive on the brush, furthermore - the brush is constantly in contact with the ground. Unlike most vacuums where the height adjusts depending on floor type selected - this vacuum just simply increases/decreases power and/or flow.The brush is also not quickly detachable for cleaning which is odd, the power cord seems short even though listed at 8 metres, the brush (when you actually want it to work) stops/blocks constantly.The only positives: powerful, quiet, lightweight.Negatives: virtually unusable - maybe best suited to cheap, office type carpet with almost no pile.Returning will be a faff so I'm just going to put it on marketplace and go back to trusty hoover brand.",2.0,2025-02-04,United Kingdom

It's a bit of an office running joke that it's like mary poppins bag! The front zip compartment has some nice little pockets to put things like paracetamol in and a key ring to attach keys too - this is very helpful as I have mini caribeaners on all my keys as I often loose them at the bottom of bags.I carry some WEIGHT around in this bag on a daily basis - with lunch, a coat, laptop, books and all the other usual stuff I carry with me and the stitching is still as good as it was new.It's very hardwearing and a very useful bag, and also very comfortable to wear due to the padded back and straps - I often see other people on the train with them.Overall a brilliant bag.",5.0,2024-10-10,United Kingdom

It's never going to be used for trekking except in the urban jungle.It seems water resistant when I was in a couple of showers but I dont think it came with a rain guard but has never leaked but not been in a torrential rain storm. One downside is I find the side netting to be slightly smaller in terms of depth so if I put a 500ml bottle or drink flask there is tends to pop out. For the price I got very happy.

I wanted a decent size bag and so ordered the blue one as I wanted something a little different from the usual black or grey bags. I might be in my 50's but I still want something different :-) This fits the bill. It looks great, almost a denim blue colour. This has more zips and compartments than any bag I have had previously, so if you want lots of storage options and zips, this is the perfect bag for you. There is a great zipped compartment on the back, really good for security as it will be against your body. A couple of pick up handles on top. Nice comfortable adjustable straps. Mani compartment holds my laptop nicely in the sleeve with a safety strap over the top - maybe a little more padding but fine. The double zips can be zipped very low down so they are not at the top of your bag and vulnerable.  There's a middle compartment, with some pouches where you can plug in your power pack to feed the outside USB port, nice but doubt I'd use much.

His is a dark blue one, which means that it hides muck or scuffs very well.Initially I thought it was a wee bit on the expensive side but looking at the bag now in February 2022, and having seen it used I think that whatever perceived initial reservations about the price have now evaporated.This seems to be a very well designed and made back pack for schooling/college that stands up well to day to day use.The pack consists of the following (working from the front to back where the pack rests on your back):(The compartments are listed numerically - as you move through compartments, they get bigger)There are two external mesh markets to dry wet items or for small water bottles on either side.1. A zipped expandable pocket just below the rubber 'Matein' logo.2. Small zipped compartment with secondary inner pockets pens, keys, money built in.3. A larger compartment divided up into three storage areas, two of which are mesh and also has the headphone access port for your data/music storage etc.4. The last and largest compartment (widest and deepest) for your laptop or large folders are also divided up into two storage areas, the furthest one having a retaining strap held down by Velcro.Each compartment is separated by a really decently thick material - not flimsy at all really- and at no risk of it being ripped under normal use.  There is a thick top heavy duty carrying handle half between the four compartments.The part of the back pack that rests on the user's back has two raised mesh shoulder pads at the top and another less heavy weight top carrying handle here too.The lumbar region has a raised mesh covered pad so that there is air gap on the users' back to give a little relief from sweat on hot days (the top pads and the bottom ones work together to create this gap). There is also a zipped compartment above the lumbar pad perhaps for valuables to be stored so that  they are less  less visible.There is a thin strap going across the middle of the back area of the pack too - maybe to help you to pick it up or you could fold an item of clothing (a jumper perhaps) over it and carry it along between you and the pack.The shoulder straps are not like (say) a hiking pack - they are more cushioned and don't look like they'd survive repeated trips into the hills and mountains.  However, they are still sturdily attached to the pack after nearly 7 months of use carrying folders, water bottles, coats etc.I was very impressed by the standard of finish  - no loose threads anywhere with very tidy and strong stitching through out which I have not seen on other more well know brands.So far so very good.Highly recommended and worth the money I think even against the big brand names I've seen in comparison.",5.0,2022-02-06,United Kingdom 
R20KGZ0LZ3O2M6,"The bag is well designed with plenty of separating pockets.  The laptop section is padded and feels secure.  The design looks appealing and the colour nice.

I’ve spent the last few weeks researching backpacks for my next trip and trying not to buy the expensive backpacks that are continuously advertised all over socials! Luckily, I came across this backpack, and I’m so pleased I have. It has so many pockets! Plus, they’re all a perfect size, and the zips open up wide. So helpful for travel and accessible. It should make security at airports far easier! There’s even a hidden pocket at the back, perfect for cards or your passport. Even my sister noted this brilliant feature.

I don’t use it for a laptop, but did use it for a flight carry on with two iPads and a kindle, as well as jackets, jumpers and snacks. I love the different sections and zipped compartments. It’s comfortable to wear and I think it looks smart. The external usb socket, to me would be better being internal, cos I’m not going to have my gadget in the open side pocket where I can’t see it, but then if it’s inside, where the Powerbank also has to be, it means the usb socket isn’t needed!

RCDME9WPU8BJY,Just what I needed after using a few thick books to get the screen on a level with my eyes. It's stiff to adjust but that's fine - you don't want it collapsing. My laptop sits easily on top and is a much better angle - I use a keyboard as well but it's useful to have the laptop keyboard accessible.  Saves so much space on my desk and I can  put the speaker underneath. Doesn't slip although you can glide it across to clear the desk for space - it's sturdy enough and the balancing point is fine - it's not going to tip over. I only use it at home so having to adjust it several times a day if travelling isn't needed but it seems that you can probably tighten it up if you slip out the wee pads that hide the joints.,5.0,2025-03-03,United Kingdom

R9QISSRJFPGSA,It’s very lightweight but very strong. There are no visible points of an hinge tightening mechanism but I think they are there under the rubber plugs on the hinges themselves. This was a concern as over time the hinge may loosen but to be fair it’s a really tight fitting hinge and should last for sometime and if it loosens then it should be easy enough to pop out the rubber plugs and tighten it back up. Very good all round build quality and it holds my HP 845 G7 very easily. Nice grippy rubber pieces all round. The 2cm high end stops are a good height for HP Elitebooks which have a sloping design underneath unlike the now flat bottomed Macs.It folds flat enough for my very old skool Crumple messenger bag and slips in easy enough without taking much space.

Assembly took me about an hour.The chair is very comfortable in all respects but I was surprised to find that at full height, it is only just high enough for me at my 76cm desk.

No tools required. I have purchased another one for my colleage in my office.,5.0,2025-03-20,United Kingdom 
RUQI85NQHWP1M,"Overall Pros & Cons:Pros:1. Cheap.2. Installation tools provided.3, Easy to follow manual.4. Breathable mesh material.5. Cushioning on seat base & some cushioning on head support.6. You can sit on it & it won't break.Cons:1. Cheap feeling & construction.2. Arm-Wrest, seat & head support mesh material can be uncomfortable with direct-skin contact.3. Insufficient cushioning on arm wrest & head support.4. Unsatisfactory quality & adjustability of head-support & terrible adjustability of lower-back support.5. Chair creeks when the tilt pedal is pressed into the chair to lock it from tilting.First things first - This is a budget chair. It is not an impressive chair by any means, but it does the job. I purchased this to replace a ""gaming"" chair that had the metal back support bracket explode, resulting with the chair not having any back/leaning support (the chair would lean so far back, you'd fall off.Assembly - The chair comes with a picture-based, easy-to-follow manual & includes screws, spacers & an Alan key. You do not require any further tools other than what comes with the chair. You also don't need any experience to install the chair (it's that easy, just read the manual).Parts - The screws, spacers & Alan key parts were of a decent quality. No obvious defects or cheap-tool signs like non-centred bit hole on the screw. The screw holes of the chair & chair parts are larger than expected & some screw holes require spacers so the screw holds the parts together properly. My best guess it that the chair has some tolerance for manufacturing variance.Chair - The chair has a breathable mesh material for the back, which feels okay (your clothes layer over it, so it's not too bad.) The chair seat & arm-rest are made of the same mesh like cushioning material (different to the elastic mesh material that makes up the back of the chair. The arm-wrest has little-to-no cushioning to it & the mesh material can feel rough & uncomfortable sometimes, both on the chair & arm-wrest, especially when you wear short & a T-shirt & your legs & arms are rubbing against the material.The plastic construction of the chair looks cheap but the main structure of the chair doesn't seem to be unreasonably flimsy or bendy.The lumbar support is pretty terrible in my opinion - it has 2 ""clicks"" of adjustability & never feels comfortable in any position.The head-support is also pretty unsatisfactory - it's plastic construction looks & feels cheap & the stability of the head-support is pretty flimsy. Adjustability is slightly better than the lumbar support, but it is made of the similarly uncomfortable mesh as the arm-wrest & chair seat base & the head-support has a very flimsy vertical adjustability. It does, however, have a little bit of cushioning which makes it less terrible than the arm-wrest.The ""Tilt-resistance"" knob under the chair requires a lot of twisting in order to slightly adjust the resistance of the chair tilt. The chair makes some creaking noise when you try to tilt backwards with the tilt pedal pressed into the chair, so I personally prefer to keep the pedal pulled out so the chair can tilt freely.The pedal on the chair controls vertical lift of the gas lift (press the pedal up) as well as tilt of the chair (when pulled in/out of the chair). When the pedal allows for tilt, there is no adjustability or locking for how far the chair will tilt. It either tilts or it doesn't.To conclude, I've had this chair for about 2 weeks. So far there are no immediate defects or cracks/breaks that would make me go through the effort of sending the chair back. I am slightly annoyed, however. with the plastic screw hole covers as they tend to pop out after about every half week of using the chair.Would I recommend you buy this chair? If you have a very little budget & don't want to use a second hand chair or need a quick replacement chair that won't give you short term back & head pain, sure it will likely do the job. If you want a chair with consistent higher build quality with better back/head/lumbar support & tilt adjustability, I'd recommend you purchase a different chair.",3.0,2024-08-11,United Kingdom

RA4ENVP66D8N9,"I’ll say this: for the price, it’s good value. Comfy enough, looks decent – a nice addition to my home office. But here’s the rub (and believe me, you’ll hear the rub): it’s a bit... squeaky. Not ""mildly amusing sitcom-level squeaky,"" but full-on “Are we filming a low-budget horror movie?” squeaky.Sit still, and you’re golden. Move even slightly – adjust your posture, lean back, or God forbid, swivel – and it’s like the chair’s auditioning to be in a percussion band. The 90° flip-up armrests are nice, but I reckon they’re just there to distract you from the symphony of squeaks the rest of the chair produces.In summary: a bargain if you plan to sit motionless, but if you like to fidget or recline, you’ll find yourself questioning life choices. Or at least chair choices.3 stars – functional, but it’s not exactly a quiet achiever.",3.0,2025-01-10,United Kingdom

If comfort and durability are priorities, consider investing in a higher-quality chair.",4.0,2025-02-03,United Kingdom 
R3KA2LFXKL7YKT,"When I first received the chair, the gas lift part had either lost pressure or wasn't pressurised correctly, I'm not heavy, and the lift couldn't support my weight. I immediately contacted the seller, and they sent me a new lift within a few days, which worked. I was very impressed.The main reason I bought it was that I'm a studio guitarist so being able to push the arms back when recording guitar parts is an excellent feature.Very easy to build, with very good instructions.  All bolts are separated and very well labelled in a blister pack.  One feature worth mentioning here is that one of the legs on the base, bolts on.  My initial thought was, why? But then, I needed to get the chair through a narrow passageway and immediately realised why.  I simply unbolted it, got the chair through and re-attached it.The chair is comfortable for a budget office chair, I wouldn't want to sit in it for too long but then again, it is not good to sit down for extended periods of time anyway, is it?  You have one tilt stop, mine is done up, I don't like to tilt. The other control is the gas lift arm which works well.  Castors run silently and only minor squeaks and creaks, which were easily sorted with a little WD40 and Silicone spray.As it needed some work to get it up and running, I'm giving it a four but for the price, I paid fifty quid, it's more like a four and a half.",4.0,2025-01-11,United Kingdom 
R1VLWSQHBCI1P,"I work from a home office and needed a new chair as my old one was creaking, but I was hesitant as it was still comfortable and well padded. I chose this item because a number of reviews mentioned how comfortable it was over long periods, however I don't agree with this. I'm of average build, 6ft tall, and have no issues with the seat adjustment and height. The problem is the seat padding is not as lush as the product description would lead you to believe - you can definitely feel the base of the chair through the seat cushion, and after a relatively short while, it's uncomfortable.The other, minor complaint is that when fixing the base mechanism, the holes are too small for the supplied washers and it's impossible to fix as the install guide suggests. Leaving them out doesn't seem to be an issue, so it's a minor point.Overall, I will be looking to change it for something more suitable and wouldn't consider it again for an office chair.",3.0,2025-03-18,United Kingdom

RPOHUC2MHFUW5,"This chair was perfect for what I needed it for at the time - my budget was limited and my previous chair was broken. For context, I'm not a serial chair-breaker, I am around 5'11"" and 90kg, and I'm usually sat on it around 4-7 hours a day.Assembly was easy and quite fun, I had no issues and the tools it came with worked fine. My initial thoughts were that the arm-rests' material was quite sharp; I typically sit in a t-shirt, so my elbows or forearms are directly against the rests, and the depth of the gripped material took some getting used to.I bought this chair about a year ago (January 2024, it is now January 2025) and the chair is noticably listing to the right side. I sit on it relatively straight, but over a year's use it has tilted further and further, to the point where it has a noticable 20 degree slope when empty. This is exacerbated when reclined, as it tilts towards the right. This is fine for me, who has spent a year getting used to it, but anybody else using my chair immediately gets thrown off-balance and complains.As it is holding its structure, but at a 20 degree angle, I determined that it was the internal metal structure that has warped over time. Now, I am by no means skinny, but I definitely did not think of myself as dense enough to bend an apparently indestructible and sturdy chair, so this review comes as a result of a slightly bruised ego.This chair will do you fine if you only have exactly as much money as it costs to buy it, but I am sure that if you shop around or buy a nicer one it will last longer than mine has. The sharp arm-rest issue may also not be a big deal for those in jumpers, hoodies, or with hairy arms; I will leave that up to you to decide.TL;DR: Chair started sharp and ended wonky",3.0,2025-01-20,United Kingdom

R284RZKJVQXJTS,"This chair represents an outstanding value for your money. I got it on offer at £45.88, but even at full price I would say it's a bargain.It comes disassembled as shown in the pictures, but all you need is the included hex-key and less than 20 minutes. Instructions are easy to follow and parts are clearly marked. I would say that my only complain here is that the hex key is not of the best quality and I had difficulties with one of the screws after it rounded the socket.Keep in mind that the chair is on the smallish side. I'm 1.82m tall and sitting upright I couldn't find a position for the headrest that was completely comfortable, it just sit probably 1cm too low for my neck. Not terrible to be honest, and well within what you would expect at this price point,The included castors are quite small, but they roll really smoothly, even on carpet. They actual contact surface is not the usual black abrasive nylon, but a softer white plastic. They are not rubber though, so I'm not sure how much they would avoid marring laminate floors.The tilt and height adjustment works well and it's easily accesible from the side. There is also the usual screw to tighten or losen the reclining function. Overall it feels solid enough.The headrest design is not the best. It makes the head rest to sit too far to the front, instead of being in  line with the back of the chair like more expensive models. It's also not as smooth in operation as the rest of the chair, almost as it was an afterthought on an otherwise well rounded piece of furniture.The cushion is quite firm, almost hard, but after sitting all day long I can say that my bottom has no complains and it's more comfortable than the first impression I got.The upholstery looks nice, but it's clearly in line with the price of the chair. Time will tell how it fares under daily use.Overall I think it's a bargain and I would totally recommend it. I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the issues with the head rest. If you are getting the model without it, it should be a 5-star chair.",4.0,2024-03-06,United Kingdom

RY8LQCCUCM3VH,"I was aware that this was likely to be pretty basic and not as good as it claims to be, so overall I'm okay with my purchase (it is about half the price of an actual orthopaedic office chair, lets be fair - I was not expecting that).Whilst I may be experienced enough to not be surprised by what I got, and in fact purchased knowing full well this would almost definitely be the case - not everyone would be aware enough to keep their expectations down and quite rightly so, because the image detailing the 'tilt feature' is very misleading.It doesn't tilt per say, its simply like almost all office chairs have in that it isn't completely rigid and has a bit of flex when leaning back (this is normally to prolong life and endurance of the fixings, as well as reduce the chances of accidentally tipping completely over when leaning back sharply). If you're above a certain weight (and I'm not suggesting you have to be 'large'), I'd imagine you will get more of the leaning back feature that I was hoping I might get.Given my weight (or lack there of, I guess), I have to push down on the legs with my feet - quite concertedly - whilst holding onto the desk in order to 'tilt' it back and it only moves back about 2-3 inches really, whilst returning to its original position as soon as I let go. I'd imagine a fair amount of people will be large/heavy enough for it to just tilt back *slightly* when they lean back into the chair, so I appreciate that my petit size is going to limit my enjoyment. But the imagery above is not in anyway accurate of the actual functioning of the chair. It takes me to undo the knob underneath for full flexibility and forcibly push the seat upward from the front and hold the legs down with my arms to get it to 30 degrees, its just not possible when sitting in it for me (I weight 53kg, for anyone needing a reference).Not complaining about my purchase and its pretty much what I expected. Delivery was prompt, its comfortable and suits my needs for the most part. And its definitely a big improvement over my £40 Ikea basic office chair. But I wanted to give a thorough review for others considering it so you at least know what your getting before spending the money. Don't get me wrong, its a decent enough chair for £50-60. But the description makes it out to be more than it is. If you want a proper orthopaedic chair and *actual* tilt features, you probably will need to fork out the £100-120 or whatever it is (unless you get a deal or offer).",4.0,2023-06-05,United Kingdom

R26RJ7WEC21KW,"Pros:Easy Installation: Setting it up was a breeze. The instructions were clear, and I had it ready to use in no time.Sturdy Build: The chair feels solid and well-built, giving confidence in its durability.Reclining Option: The recline feature is decent and works as expected, making it somewhat comfortable for longer sessions.Cons:Fabric Quality: The mesh fabric is durable but far from comfortable. It’s coarse to the touch, and while it’s fine when sitting with clothes on, my bare elbows or hands on the armrests feel itchy and almost like a burning sensation. On top of that, the mesh attracts debris and hair, making it hard to keep the chair looking clean.Headrest Issue: If you have a shorter torso, don’t bother with the headrest. It’s positioned awkwardly and becomes practically useless. I’d recommend skipping the headrest entirely.Seat Cushion: The seat cushion is disappointing.

R2YNTIHXMKIK9Y,"Had this chair for a month now. The design looks nice and it certainly look great and easy to put together. However you get what you pay for, the material is on the cheap side, and the chair doesn't ""line up"" perfectly - you can see and feel it is mildly lobsided. There is definitely something out of line on weight distribution most probably caused by this lob-sidedness. The padding of the seat is relatively thin and cannot retain it's shape very well, adding a seat cushion is an option but the problem with weight distribution out beat the little comfort an extra cushion adds.Conclusion is that it is not comfortable enough to sit for too long. It is my office chair so I have to frequently stand up before ache sets in on my bum. The back of the chair is ok though.

Back support is okay but isn’t regulated so you’re sitting in same position all the time. Pretty sturdy and wheels work really nice. However, in terms of comfort it’s cheap. The cushion is thin so after an hour of sitting you can feel the frame through it, which gets uncomfortable. But nothing a pillow can’t fix. It’s also quite low compared to a standard office chair even on the highest setting.

It rolls smoothly and is great as a first desk chair. However, I've had this chair for around 4 months, and I'm neither impressed or unimpressed. It's a mostly comfortable chair with its problems.Firstly, the seat is uncomfortable for me. I have to place a pillow on it and if I'm sat upright, I still feel uncomfortable after a while. When the backrest is locked in place it still moves around a lot, with a preference to want to fall on the left or right side - never directly back. It gives the feeling like there's a pole behind you and the chair can only move backwards either side of it.Lastly, it's started squeaking a lot and it's unbearable. I need to source a good lubricant and hope that I can identify where the sound is originating from, which is inconvenient and disappointing, because the chair was a lot better at first.I've seen a lot of reviews praising this chair which is what encouraged me to make a purchase as well, but I wish I had bought a different one.

The delivery was excellent—everything arrived on time and in perfect condition, with no damaged parts. The packaging was well thought out, ensuring all components were protected.One thing I really appreciated during assembly was how well-organised the screws were. Each type was clearly separated, making it easy to find the right ones without any confusion. The included Allen key was also a great addition, making assembly much more straightforward.However, I did encounter a small issue when attaching the wooden base to the metal stand. The screws had to be driven directly into the wood, which was a bit tricky and required some extra effort. While doing this, I also noticed that a small amount of paint started chipping off the wood, which was a little frustrating. It wasn’t a major issue, but it did take away from the otherwise smooth assembly process.That said, once assembled, the desk feels sturdy and functions well. The height adjustment is smooth and reliable, and the overall design looks sleek and modern.

Considerations:- Adjustment Mechanism: The adjustment mechanism works smoothly. However, when I sit and change my posture, my knee sometimes hits the spinning bar underneath. I'm a bit worried I might break it, but I try to be careful.- Top Thickness: I wish the top was thicker. It's currently 15mm, which works for monitor grip stands, so it's acceptable.

It's also a single piece so no issues with two pieces not sitting quite flush with each other. All the parts needed were included, with many spares.The issues I had were minor, definitely not enough to detract from 5 stars but worth mentioning. The cable management clips on the back are just bad. They're fragile (one snapped) and not big enough, the surviving clip won't close with only 3 USB cables. The edges of the desk are also a little on the sharp side.But aside from that, unbelievably good value for money and would highly recommend!",5.0,2025-03-02,United Kingdom

R1TLO95UZZ4YVK,"I spend most of my day, both working and gaming. I purchased this desk, and I'm extremely impressed with it. It is a huge upgrade from my previous one.Assembly was easy, I was able to build the desk in about 30 minutes. The instructions are clear. The surface area is generous, I have two monitors (27"" and 24""), a PC, and a label printer. I have plenty of space. I love the cup holder and headphone holder.The sit-stand functionality is also a game changer. The saving of preferred sitting and standing heights is so easy, which is incredibly convenient. Saving your preferred settings makes it easy. I'm super impressed with this purchase!If you're considering a sit/stand desk, this is the one to buy.

My partner is really tall and often finds regular desks constraining on his legs due to the space and size often hitting his knees. This desk has especially been a life saver for him as he’s able to adjust the height to his needs whether sitting or standing and allows us to hit our daily step count when using it as a standing desk on long workdays.Unfortunately, the bigger desk of the 2 arrived damaged from the transit but the seller was helpful in solving the issue.

R11NUSP3W6EX45,"Arrived quickly, had a bash in the packaging, but luckily was well enough packed to not get through to the table itself. My first impression on opening was that it was going to be a confusing build. The instructions refer to A, B, C, etc, but there are no labels on the packaging for each item, so I just had to work out which was which, especially the screws which I ended up counting to match the instructions to know which was which. Also some of the illustrations are quite small. I did try looking online for a build video which would have helped, but didn't find any, so just took my time and the table was built after around an hour - and thankfully worked first time.It's works really nicely. The table surface feels fine - not particularly high end (not expected at this price), and the motor is smooth and fairly quiet, and it's lovely to have the freedom of either standing or sitting to work at. It feels well made and nice to use. The up down buttons do look a little worn out (and nothing like the picture), but this doesn't bother me - they work.Overall, highly recommended.

The smallest one they have (110 cm) is the only one in a single piece, and it is good enough for 1 32"" monitor and 2 laptops. The motor is not THAT slow that it would annoy you or be very loud as some reviews said. It's at an acceptable normal speed and volume that you would expect when something moves. My only problem is that the position of the motor that could only be installed 1 way, facing you and quite close to the middle that you might knock it either with your knee or chair.

ROXLZAUX33RPN,"This is the fourth standing desk I've assembled so I am comparing to the previous ones. This one is by far the cheapest; I didn't realize until I received the desk that the desktop was in 2 separate pieces. I don't really like having a seam down the middle, but it is very well supported underneath. This desk is lighter weight than the others because the desk top is thinner. It also has a cut out in back and two holes for cords, whereas I prefer a solid rectangular top. The assembly was easier than I expected. Initially I thought it would take a long time because there were a lot more pieces to put together than the previous desks I've done, but the assembly instructions were easy to follow and most importantly, most of the assembly was with metal-to-metal bolts that went together flawlessly and quickly. Wood screws were used to attach the desk top to the stand, but even those holes were predrilled well and were sufficiently big to accommodate the screws, unlike with some furniture where you have to struggle because the predrilled holes aren't big enough. The allen wrench that came with the desk had a Phillips head on one end (for the wood screws), so I didn't need any additional tools.  The desk is a little slow when moving to standing position (I have another desk that is much faster), but on the other hand, you don't have to keep your hand on the button as it's moving up. Just make sure it's not going to run into anything. Overall this was very good value for the money - about a third of what I've paid for previous desks.",4.0,2024-09-09,United Kingdom

However, one consideration is that the motor may obstruct leg space when the desk is set to a low height. For individuals around 5'11"", like myself, there can be instances where the right knee may bump against the motor while seated.

The instructions are simple enough to follow as long as you ensure to read them properly, if you're unsure check ahead to see if a picture shows a part from a different angle. The cable management accessories were a good touch, though my cables refuse to be managed as pictured, they allow you to hold the cables up to where you can't see them, and keep them tidy at the back. There's also a cup holder which I'm hoping will put me off staining the desk with coffee. There's a lot of holes under the desk to put the accessories in the preferred place.It's easy and smooth to lower and raise, and the instructions tell you how to set a preferred standing and sitted position so you don't have to hold in the button. Other reviews say the desk is unstable, I haven't experienced this even when raised. You should not be placing much weight on any kind of standing desk when raised, as it goes against the purpose of helping posture.Overall, this desk has allowed me to clear my set up and have a more comfortable desk space, as well as easily change my position while working so I can use my portable treadmill.I had some problems with delivery, Amazon tracking says 11th but I got a text on 9th saying it was coming so I had to leave the office and it also arrived before the designated time slot.

R1BQF9O4FBV2Z5,"Looking for a standing desk that's easy on the wallet and doesn't require an engineering degree to assemble? This hidden gem might be your perfect fit! Let me tell you why.First off, compared to some of the bigger brands, this desk offers fantastic value. You get all the functionality of an electric standing desk without the hefty price tag.Important note for potential buyers: I saw some reviews mentioning a two-piece tabletop that needs to be joined to make the table. Here's the good news: the 110x60cm size I got actually came as a single piece! This seems like the description might not be entirely clear across all sizes, so be sure to double-check if a one-piece top is important to you.This one-piece design made assembly a breeze – I had it up and running in under 30 minutes, way faster than what others experienced.There's one minor caveat: the motor does make a bit more noise than I expected when adjusting the height. But honestly, it doesn't bother me a bit, especially since I work from a home office without anyone else around.Overall, if you're looking for a budget-friendly standing desk with a one-piece top (at least for the 110x60cm size) and a super easy assembly, this is a fantastic option. Just be aware of the slightly louder motor if noise sensitivity is a concern for you.",4.0,2024-07-13,United Kingdom

It's a home office and if I was installing this in a prominent location I would consider the other top - the wood looks cheap.I am a pretty confident DIY'er and I was able to assemble this without too much trouble, however I can imagine there are many who might not have the same experience.There were alot of screws and you really did have to be careful how you arranged the pieces.Overall the desk works perfectly, however I am not impressed with its lateral movement (left to right) - everything is tight and as it should be, but the table has a slight wobble (even at its lowest setting). More expensive tables are much sturdier in my experience however at this price I did not expect it to be rock solid. I expect to add a brace with clamps to remedy the problem but this shouldn't be necessary.If the manufacturer is considering some product re-development - I would focus on three areas:a) Reducing the lateral movement, perhaps by extending and positioning the articulated spreader at the top of the upright (attached to the underside frame) further down the upright.b) Improving the jointing method of the top. Perhaps consider a dowl joint alongside the spreader bracket which could be sit inside a routed out space.c) Provide some cable management mounted under the top - there are cable ports at each end and some cable management in the central area but nothing to form any kind of trunking or run cables from one end to the other.

The motor isn't noisy when raising or lowering the position and the build quality is very good.My only criticism is the power lead that goes to the motor hangs under the desk. It would be nice to see this having some cable management so that it is protected when the desk raises and lowers.

R1PZA8EE5PDX94,"I purchased the 110 x 60 version in black when it was on sale for £73.09. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, I just wanted the cheapest option to see if a standing desk worked for me. It was shipped quickly and packaged very well. The instructions were pretty clear. I would say assembly was almost on par with Ikea. There are a few bits that might require two people with the bigger desks, but I was able to do it by myself fine with the smaller one. It also came with spares of all of the hardware. The desk surface was also one solid piece. I was expecting two pieces (as this is a common strategy to reduce shipping cost, and other reviews had mentioned it), but I guess the smaller surface fits in the box whole! I wouldn't expect it to be one piece for the larger sizes though.The desk itself it more stable than I was expecting. I get a little bit of monitor wobble (with a monitor arm) if I purposefully hit the desk, but under normal use, it is sturdy enough. The motor definitely isn't premium, but is quiet enough and not too slow (pretty good for the price, I would say).The mechanical linkage between the legs gets in the way sometimes, but that is a design choice that allows the cost to be so low, so I wouldn't say it is an issue with the product, just a compromise to bear in mind.The only ""issue"" was that there is a weird gap in the up and down arrow icons on the control panel.

R1Q0NR6NCX00MS,"We decided on the white frame and white top SANODESK in size 110 x 60cm. This was the smallest size we could find to fit the bedroom space we have available yet there is so much desktop realestate and freedom to work.Instructions were easy to follow and there were spare fittings. I did not fit the cup holder as this would get in the way of the curtains but the headphones hook is very useful. The controller could be positioned either side but right works best for us because it is furthest away from the windows and curtains, afterall you do not want obstructions that could catch or get in the way. TIP: Leave enough space away from window ledges so it doesn't damage the surface edges when it is raised for the first time and so on...You will appreciate that the desktop has pre-drilled holes underneath, with more than one position should you need to make adjustments to where you place the controller, hook or cup holder.The desktop has a recessed back for cables to pass through plus two clips to hold them in place. Make sure you do a test run to see how long your cables need to be so there is clearance each and every time you raise your new SANODESK to standing position to avoid cables pulling that could result in disaster.The legs have four adjustable feet incase you have uneven floors. Probably will not be a problem on carpet.The SANODESK is a much healthier choice for anyone who is spending alot of time sitting and working because you can easily change it to a standing desk in under 30 seconds! This will give your back and legs relief aswell as putting your body back into an upright and more natural position reducing strain, aches and pains from sitting for long periods of time. Always take regular breaks away from your desk.You will find it easy to programme your desired sitting and standing heights into the controller memory to raise or lower positioning accurately every time at the press of a single button.

R309VQUPUA2CFH,"I was genuinely sceptical of all the glowing reviews of this desk, but wanted to try a sit-stand desk to improve posture and to help me move a little more during the work day.I am blown away by how impressive this desk is for the price, particularly as there is a hand-crank one available at everyone's fave Swedish superstore for over double the price!The desk looks fab (though my cable management lets it down colossally.. but that's on me!). The worktop is solid and feels nice to work on. There is a cup holder and a headphone hook which fit easily and solidly into the desk with pre-prepared screw holes. There is actually a little indented bit on the back of the desk to help with cable management and you can clip your cables into that, but I have yet to do this, hence why this review has no pictures....Assembly instructions are not entirely clear, but with common sense you can build it with relative ease. It comes with a little allen-key-screwdriver thingy which also helps the screwdriverless.I have my desk on thick carpet (a gentle brag) and it feels sturdy. Yes if I violently shake it, it wobbles about a bit. But truthfully - who is typing so hard they shake their desk? It's not a deal breaker for me and my screen, laptop and various other items on the desk don't even budge.It's got a good memory and the motor is smooth and changes between sitting and standing well. Yes, you can hear it because it has a motor in it, duh.

This was over two weeks after I had made the purchase. After waiting another week with no updates I tried to cancel the order so I could order a new desk. The cancelation request was ""pending"" for another two weeks. Then I finally received a notification that (A) the desk had shipped and (B) Amazon couldn't cancel my order because it had shipped. So I received the desk about 3 weeks later than expected. It's unethical that the company that made this desk and Amazon delay shipping indefinitely and don't allow you to cancel the order when it hasn't been delivered by the original date given.

(Seriously if you don't believe go check out IKEA and then run back here!)Assembly was a breeze – no sweat, no tears, just a straightforward setup that had me up and running in no time. The instructions were easy to follow, I built this by myself in maybe 30-40 minutes? The design? Sleek and modern in black. And the space? Plenty of it for my computer, two screens, comes with a coffee mug holder and headphone holder (I opted to install just the headphone holder personally).But here’s the main reason for buying this desk, at the push of a button I can stand up, stretch my legs, and keep the workflow going without missing a beat. My back’s thanking me (I injured it last year) and it's really helping me mange it. I'm a 6'2 guy and the desk actually goes up quite high to accommodate my height (if you are tall I would recommend elevating your screens as I have for ergonomics).You can set your sit and stand preferences at the touch of a button, it's so good. Honestly I never write reviews and this one is so long because I'm so happy with this purchase. Oh! It's also really sturdy, I know some people mentioned it was slightly unstable but I have not experienced that at all and I'm on hardwood flooring, even tried rocking it a bit!In short, if you’re on the fence about getting a sit-stand desk, hop off and grab this one.

The backpack hook is a thoughtful touch, keeping my bag off the floor and within reach.However, there are a few areas that could use some improvement.

Lift off lid, quiet, stable, quick boil, 2.8l max if needed, varied temperature choice, and illuminated. Red light when on boil which turns to green when reached either 100 degrees or chosen temp from 70 degrees upwards, and afterwards when you’ve poured your water into your tea or coffee mug or whatever and place it back on its base it switches to a white light. It’s quite a cheerful little thing on a dark morning ☺️",5.0,2025-02-04,United Kingdom

RKJRL1SSTIQY8,"The kettle itself is really good. It’s the first kettle I’ve owned, where the flick switch doesn’t bounce back up if you take it off the stand (while boiling) to add more water, which to me is a plus. Aesthetically, it looks good, but the trim at the top of mine kept pinging off on one side after we’d had it a few days. It got really annoying and hard to put back on when the kettle is full of hot water, so my partner removed the trim altogether.  It doesn’t really detract too much from the appearance, but I’ve knocked one star off for this, as a little more thought into the design would have prevented this happening, as the trim was tucked into the handle on both sides.  The lid needs removing altogether to fill, and it fits on really well, with a satisfying ‘click’ into place, and doesn’t get too hot to touch, if you need to refill to reuse straight away.I don’t consider it to be a noisy kettle, but obviously you can hear it as it heats the water up. It’s not as tall as my previous kettle, although it holds the same amount of water, it’s just slightly wider round the girth of the kettle instead. It doesn’t take too long to boil, I’ve had slower kettles, it all depends on the wattage of the kettle of course. I boiled my kettle twice (and discarded the water each time) before using it to make tea/coffee, but there were no obvious ‘factory odours’ lingering on the kettle prior to first boiling.  Overall, it doesn’t what it’s supposed to do, and I’m happy with that.",4.0,2025-01-30,United Kingdom

R2XKV39HO827LG,"I ran a boiling test. Here's the data:volume: just a smidge over 1.8 Lstarting temp: 13Ctime duration until rolling boil: 4 minutes (240s) (beeping takes a few more seconds)elevation here is not high enough to matter given the somewhat fuzzy definition of ""done""(100C - 13C) * 1800mL * 4.1868J/calorie / (4 minutes * 60s) == 2731.887WSo that's >= 2731 Watts power from the kettle into the water, not accounting for losses to escaping steam, losses to the air around the kettle, or heating of the kettle itself. The wattage from the wall would be higher than 2731W. I didn't measure it directly, but it could plausibly be ~3000W at 240V.This was using a dedicated circuit (aka ""dedicated radial circuit""?) that generally measures right around 240V, though I didn't measure circuit voltage while running the kettle.In contrast, a 120V ""kettle"" on a ""broken radial circuit"" is relatively pointless, but y'all already knew that.Other observations (more subjective):The ring of LED light is nice, and the white, red, and green colors all look nice.If there's a relay in this thing, it's pretty quiet.The beeping is short and to the point at a reasonable volume.The keep-warm feature is automatically on after heating, and clearly indicated by LEDs green. Picking up the kettle, the keep-warm disables, as the light is back to white when the kettle is put back down. One can hit the ON button again if keep-warm is desired after pouring. When boiling a more normal amount of water, the time to boiling is low enough that I haven't felt the need for keep-warm after pouring so far. The keep-warm until poured is nice. The keep-warm re-heating is tuned to get the water up to barely boiling and stop again, so it's not aggressively re-boiling the water each time, though it is audible - just pretty much over by the time you hear it, so not worrying.The LED stays on for just a little while when lifting the kettle; slightly longer than I'd expect. This seems to correlate with the decent build quality overall.The UI is no-nonsense and obvious.I've had no issues so far refilling with cold (~13C) water after having just boiled and poured, though I do always aim for the middle of the metal bottom to give the cold water some mixing with hot water before it hits the glass. I figure it can't hurt.The lid has a nice amount of tension (not too much, not too little), and seems less likely to break than typical push-button flip-up lids. The lid is easy to remove quickly and hold between two fingers while operating the tap for refilling - the tension is just right for getting your hand away from any lingering steam all at once. The lid being on limits the pouring rate to a reasonable-seeming rate. It seems plausible to modify the lid to allow faster pouring rate by putting some small notches or angled holes way out near the edges of the lid (to avoid scalding though the holes) - but the pouring rate seems fine as-is. I haven't tried pouring without the lid on - it's nice that the lid makes pouring safely a no-brainer before caffeine.Overall this thing seems well-thought-out and not a first draft.The wattage indicated on the box is a range up to 3000W at 240V, depending on input voltage. Lower input voltage will result in lower wattage, but that's true for any kettle.",5.0,2025-02-10,United Kingdom

R2QOMUS3Q7WJM9,"The water heats up quickly as you would expect from a 3kw kettle but it pours very badly and spits boiling water when returned to upright.  I have descaled the pot in case that was the problem but no improvement.  The pouring is poor.  The design of the unit gives a ridge inside the kettle and when you get so far with the pour the ridge inside stops the water, or holds it back you then have to tilt the kettle further to get more flow. On return to upright it spits boiling water from the pouring lip.I have given 2stars because the heating and maintaining heat is good.I bought this kettle in October so can't return it, only option is the bin and buy something that does the job properly.p.s. The hot water from the spitting as described runs down the outside of the kettle and leaves a puddle on the worktop and the charging base!  Cheers!",2.0,2025-01-10,United Kingdom

Separately, Amazon's return service for Prime members is simply the best. If is is a choice between saving few pounds with and another online retailer, Amazon wins every time, after having had awful return experience with non-prime products (mostly supplier mis-description of products and then refusal to put things right).So, the black Friday sale was just the right time for a replacement.This 23 litre compact microwave is very elegant, well made, functional, and, importantly, heats up food well and evenly. That's what I use the microwave mostly for and it is a star performer.  Not tried the other functionalities. User interface is simple and intuitive.

RM7NSRVGOS6RD,"Had this microwave for a month now and chose it because it advertised timing down to 1 second.  At first I couldn't find this, the obvious button is ""Start/+30sec"" which is much too long for softening butter but very useful for some other reheating items.  Just one button to press.  Called ""Speedy Cooking"" in instruction booklet.Eventually discovered how to set for less than 30 seconds, under ""Microwave Cook"" in instruction book.  Press ""Time Cook"" button followed by number keys eg for 5 seconds just press 5.  For 2 mins 45 secs press 2, 4, 5.  Finally press ""Start/+30 secs"" and no it doesn't add another 30 seconds.  So 3 buttons pressed for 5 secs and perfectly softened butter .Tried the ""Potato"" button but not impressed with the cooking, prefer to time it myself.  Haven't tried much else yet.Interior light is yellow which give a strange glow to the interior and food, I wonder why?So having worked out the above I am now pleased with this microwave, no other problems have arisen so far.",4.0,2024-11-10,United Kingdom

R3B57K3ABTIILQ,"I had high hopes for this Toshiba microwave, and while it does have some nice features, it didn’t quite meet my expectations.👍 Pros:✔️ Sleek Design – The black finish looks modern and stylish in my kitchen.✔️ Good Capacity – The 23L size is decent for reheating meals or cooking small portions.✔️ Position Memory Turntable – A small but helpful feature that keeps mugs and plates in the same spot after heating.👎 Cons:❌ Uneven Heating – Some foods come out scorching hot while others have cold spots.❌ Weak Grill Function – Tried making toast and grilling some food, but it takes way too long and doesn’t brown evenly.❌ Durability Issues – Worked well at first, but after a couple of months, it started making odd noises and losing power.❌ Customer Service Could Be Better – Contacted Toshiba about issues, but their response wasn’t too helpful.Overall, it’s okay for basic reheating, but the grill function is disappointing, and long-term reliability is questionable. If you're looking for something heavy-duty, this might not be the best choice. 🚫👎",2.0,2025-02-18,United Kingdom

RDWE0XKAOJ3S1,"Our previous microwave (a Sanyo) had a failed bulb that had no access to replace it and was starting to get rusty, so having read positive reviews of the Toshiba we bought one.  After almost a year I see the good points and the niggles.  The good points are that it cooks and reheats evenly, the door opens and closes easily and the instant full power for various minutes are a real asset.  The niggles are that the defrost function has 'by time' or 'by weight' options, but nothing in the manual explains how to choose the time for anything, so only the weight is usable.  Our Sanyo used to do part of the defrost, then pause for 2 minutes for temperatures to equalise then go again to finish the defrosting.  The Toshiba does it in one go, and dense foods like joints of meat need longer that the weight decides. I add 10% to the actual weight for a proper defrost without starting to cook.  The turntable rotates jerkily rather than smoothly, and it is too easy to dislodge from the drive and is fiddly to put back. The clock doesn't keep exactly to time and gradually gets fast so I had to reset it about every 6 weeks.  The time functions are not consistent:  If I Time Cook, I put in (say) 415 and it assumes a leading zero and I get 4 minutes and 15 seconds; If I use the Kitchen Timer function and put in 415 it assumes a zero on the end and I get 41 minutes and 50 seconds.  That took a bit of getting used to.  None of the niggles would put me off buying one again, but I can't give it 5 stars.",4.0,2023-12-12,United Kingdom 
R17YPY0BJ38QM6,"I got a discount and then ordered this microwave oven. I ploughed through the instructions. I tested the recommended settings and had to decide what worked regardless of the settings for various food items and their weights. Pizzas aren't my idea of fun when they finish as moist bread and warm toppings with melted bits on the tray that could take ages to clean later on. I tested again with half a full size pizza instead and still got a lot to clean up afterwards. I cut the pizza into a few sections and that helped a bit. Eventually, I gave up on getting pizzas done as I wanted. I used the pizza setting once and had to do that a second time. I then chose to let the pizza bits go cold and to eat these later.The glass tray and its circled support design is somewhat a loose fitting and tricky to get back into the oven ready for more food item experiments. The front panel settings display is too small to operate correctly every single time at a typical waist height and worktop level. I had to switch the oven plug to off as it's connected to an anti-surge switch on/off unit. Then back on again to use the settings and the set-ups for the items or the better settings after more experiments resulted in better results or compromises instead.I use a towel roll tissue to clean the water from the opened front door and along the front of the oven. Once done, I can switch off the oven and its light rather than to walk away with the power still on and the light still on. Just leave the front door slightly open and let any extra water to evaporate after a few minutes.Dried on food inside the oven or on the glass tray can be tolerated but I regard the oven as too compact for items such as pizzas and would recommend at least a 50% increase in size and a much stronger tray and support design. If potential customers think they are going to save time and money then they might be surprised at the need to experiment with settings recommended by Toshiba or the makers of the food items as shown on their packaging. I prefer the way a conventional oven cooks food and without the extra cleaning up the Toshiba has made me do.If going electric rather than gas, I'd probably suggest getting an electric oven instead. As it is, I'm continuing with the Toshiba and not using my gas oven at all for the past few weeks of testing and for the future and may even cancel getting gas and paying a daily standing charge costing about £10 a month. Such a saving would pay for a microwave oven but I'd rather get a much larger width than the Toshiba oven I bought. That's why I can suggest CARRY ON COOKING as a suitable way of experimenting with any microwave oven with a sequel entitled as CARRY ON CLEANING...",3.0,2023-08-14,United Kingdom

R2PF4U17SVHJHE,"It has no fan like my old one which is a downside. It means the door should be left open after use to dry out. Eco mode means I no longer have to flick it off at the plug. the display and light go out on their own when its not used or the door is open. You can turn eco mode off. The 2 bottom buttons are so dark Its hard to read them. They should be illuminated. The controls could be simpler. I think you would sell more if older people could use it without referring to instructions. For example grilling and microwaving at the same time is not as simple as you would think. I like the 30 second increment button but sometimes 30 seconds is to long.I gave up with defrost it didn't seem to do much.  A frozen fish pie was still frozen after a few minutes.You have to press cancel for eco mode to come on or for it to reset or it will just sit at the last setting for hours. For example of it starts over cooking and I open the door before the timer has stopped it just holds the setting.These reviews are for all models so when I asked a question the answers were very muddled. My model is the basic Toshiba 900w 23L Microwave Oven with 1050w Crispy Grill.I did call customer service who answered quickly and helped with my questions.It does not slide about and is smaller then expected but still takes a large plate.  It seems to take a while to heat up food like a minute before it even starts to warm but then it bubbles very quickly.I am happy with it and am going to keep it, I think I have had it 2 weeks now.

It's a fairly standard no frills device that allows per second timing and has a few special settings, although oddly no bread defrost button which I use a lot. I also think that all microwaves should display the power output on the front as it's easy to forget and a faff to spend longer searching for the manual than it will take to cook the ready meal you have in your hand; the previous one did, this one doesn't.

R14H8AKHCHD66O,"This item is a microwave combination and for the short time we have had it it has performed well. The problem is that the instructions are ambiguous, the instructions for the grill are rolled up with those for the microwave/grill combination. This is important as the grill is located at the top of the machine and so you will probably need to use the metal tray to raise the food towards the grill. If you haven't confirmed that the 'Grill' has been selected by pressing 'Start', use of the timer dial will select the Grill/Microwave combi and there is a danger of the user microwaving food with metal inside. Not a good idea. Just ensure you understand the steps required and execute them accordingly.Other than that the only criticisms I have is that the dial markings are not particularly distinct for an older person with less than 20/20 vision and having to set the time using a dial rather than a button.

I used to make toast using the grill, and more often than not, I'd burn it. With this toaster, the process is quick, easy, and hassle-free—no more hovering over the grill, worried about burning my toast.Pros:Extra Wide Slots: Perfect for thicker slices of bread, crumpets, or bagels. I love that I don’t have to squish my bread to fit it in.6 Browning Levels: The browning control is precise, so I can get my toast exactly how I like it—light or golden brown, it’s always consistent.Handy Functions: The frozen, reheat, and cancel buttons are really useful. The frozen setting means no more defrosting bread before toasting, and the reheat function is great if my toast cools down before I’m ready to eat.Affordable Price: For the price, this toaster offers amazing value. It’s simple but does exactly what you need it to.No More Burnt Toast: The best part for me is the pop-up feature—once the toast is ready, it pops up perfectly toasted. No more standing by the grill and accidentally burning it!Cons:Basic Design: While it looks fine, the design is quite basic. If you’re after something super stylish, it’s not the most modern-looking toaster out there.Lightweight: It’s a little lightweight, so it can move slightly when pressing down the lever, but nothing too concerning.Overall, I’m really happy with this toaster.

Unfortunately, although they do technically fit into the slot, they keep getting trapped by the squeezy prong things inside and end up totally squashed and misshapen. This situation is only worsened by lifting the lever up to try and pop them out, it then starts gouging chunks out and results me in having to switch the whole thing off at the wall and getting a knife involved so that I can sort it out.If your loaf conforms to a specific square standard it has reasonable toasting ability, looks pretty okay and it toasts pretty okay. It's a normal weight that a toaster would typically be. It will not accomodate the longer/taller slices, which i think is always going to be an issue with these little compact two-slice ones. The cord is also quite short so it needs to live fairly close to a plug socket. It just doesnt really work for crumpets :(",3.0,2024-10-05,United Kingdom 
RGIR048QU0JU8,"This attractive kitchen appliance is very efficient and I am pleased with my purchase. Since I always keep frozen bread in the freezer I find the freeze button facility very useful (it automatically adds on an appropriate amount of extra browning time). However, with the largest slices I find I have to put them in sideways, and even then force them down. And this is despite the manufacturer boasting about the toaster's big slots. Why do toaster manufacturers have such a problem understanding the word 'big' ?Update: the more I use this toaster, the more I like it. I may have been unlucky in my former choices, but this is the first toaster I have had that actually toasts both sides of the bread to the same level.",4.0,2024-08-12,United Kingdom

However, its large frame makes it feel like it should offer more than just two slices. The wide slots are a plus for bagels or thicker slices of bread, and the controls are easy to use, but everything feels a bit oversized for what it is.Performance-wise, it toasts evenly and has reliable settings, but if you're short on kitchen space, the size might be a drawback.

R2GTSPT698215Q,"I recently purchased the Dreo Tower Fan, and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. This fan is a game-changer for keeping cool during hot summer days.Firstly, the design is sleek and modern, blending seamlessly into my living room decor. It’s tall but compact, taking up minimal floor space. The setup was a breeze, and I had it up and running in minutes.The performance is outstanding. It offers multiple speed settings and oscillation options, ensuring the air circulates efficiently throughout the room. The remote control is a convenient feature, allowing me to adjust settings without leaving my seat. The timer function is also a plus, letting me set it to turn off after a few hours, which is perfect for overnight use.One of the standout features is how quiet it is, even on the highest setting. It provides a powerful breeze without the noise, making it ideal for bedrooms or offices where you need a quiet environment.Overall, the Dreo Tower Fan is an excellent investment. It’s efficient, quiet, and stylish, making it a perfect addition to any home. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and effective cooling solution.",5.0,2024-06-27,United Kingdom 
R2COIM50BWWADG,"Obviously it sounds like a fan, but I find that really soothing at night. It keeps the same noise all night. If you've had a cheap fan,  you'll know what I mean. Power 1 is great, more like a 3 or 4 on any other fan, just get it at the right angle and it's spot on.So easy to put together and doesn't make strange rattling noises like some of the cheaper fans. Remote is excellent and the sound silence button means you can turn the beeps off at night, when you use the remote. In sleep mode, it automatically turns the display lights off after 5 seconds.Honestly,  I can't recommend this fan enough.

R3ER9E44T4WYAA,After looking at reviews I chose this tower fan.. it's almost perfect. The only downside is that the cord is only around 3-4ft in length  so may need an extension cord. The fan itself is fab...has a good flow of air.. much better than my old style fan which I had for years.. this one is very quiet... Only need it on setting no1 atm but tried 4 and it's just great!! The remote control  is a godsend... has a timer as well though not used that yet!  Has an oscillating function but to be fair I havent needed to use that function either as the cool air fills the room perfectly.

RY9IV9XCS3B3B,"This is going to sound silly, but I never realised how much difference a competent tower fan makes. I have a very small room so I'm in very close proximity to it, but my god does it feel glorious.Even on the lowest setting its presence is felt and so far it's keeping me cool on the hottest day of the year (33 degrees) - granted, I have some help from closing all blinds to reject the sun from coming in, but my old fan wouldn't be able to keep up.On level 1, you can't even tell it's on it's so quiet, kick it up a notch and you trade true power for a bit of noise.Stellar purchase. My only real criticism, is the lights go off after a minute or so, but it was implied that this was only on sleep mode. Nevertheless, it doesn't affect the performance and it's me nitpicking at a design decision.It's extremely easy to assemble, no tools needed - fit the two pieces of the base together, plonk the unit onto the bass, rotate to lock, job done.No noise whilst turning (only been 5 hours or so), and the materials feel durable. Hoping it lasts!Remote comes with a battery and provides easy access to all the options.Not sure how it would perform in a bigger room, but colour me impressed, I'm just surprised at the sheer volume of air, but again, I've never had a tower fan before and I'm comparing it to desk fans and industrial fans, which, whilst can move serious air, are rather loud.Curious to see how the bigger brother 6-speed one does, but for my small room, this is perfect, and I'm actually happy to not have to connect another IOT device to my network.Highly recommend if you need a breeze.",5.0,2024-08-12,United Kingdom

R2NKCGVXWO5RUS,"I bought this fan to replace a cheap fan I’d previously bought because it was making such a high pitched almost whistle noise it was giving me a migraine. This one does not do that. Obviously it makes sound but it sounds like a soft breeze. I love the different settings, love how much it oscillates, love the design and the controls. Some people were saying the breeze is too strong for a bedroom, but my room is around 20 feet and on its highest setting it’s fine for me, around the same strength as my old fan.My only gripe with it is the cable is so insanely short. I couldn’t find anywhere on the page where it stated the cable length. It’s around 130cm. I had to change my bedroom around a little to get it closer to the plug. Not a major problem but still a bit annoying. I usually start to notice annoying sounds fans make during the night, so if I do notice any annoying noises I’ll make sure to update this review, but from what I can hear so far, it’s fine! :)Edit: slight higher pitched noise at setting 5 but not nearly as bad as my old fan, and I’ll probably never use it at 4 anyway, it makes a tiny noise when it oscillates but it’s barely noticeable unless you’re really focusing on it. 2-3 are the best settings I’d say, no high pitched noise and plenty powerful.",4.0,2024-04-29,United Kingdom

It has 4 different speeds, depending on how warm it is and even the lowest setting makes a big difference on a warm night. You can set it to rotate or just stay in a fixed position.

R8GOSHH48A0LL,"This was a very disappointing purchase. I bought it for a bedroom because it was advertised as a silent fan. However, in reality, it is actually MUCH louder than advertised. I measured it between 53 and 55dB at the lowest speed setting, which would be very intrusive during the night. Higher speeds  were even louder. Given that a mere 3dB increase represents a doubling of the noise level (sound is measured on a log scale), the difference between the advertised 28dB and measured 54dB is absolutely huge. I would therefore NOT recommend this as suitable for a bedroom, particularly if you are a light sleeper.On a more positive note, it does generate significant air flow even at the lowest speed, has four speed settings and a very modest floor footprint.

I like the different speeds and the oscillation/no oscillation choice similar to the typical round faced fans out there.  It was also very easy to move back and forth to our living room when we had an extra hot week.

RRDKALTVYWUGK,Ok so a little unsightly. It’s big. It’s tall. It’s black and stands out in our room.BUTThis fan is the best.The screen turns itself off so the room doesn’t have an annoying light shining anywhere. The cooling on it. Amazing. Even on 1 it so cooling. 4 is like a wind tunnel and really has an affect on a blisteringly hot day. The rotation on it is great. Gets the majority of a room.Couldn’t tell you about the remote. Lost it about 3 minutes after getting it.Would recommend this fan to anyone!,5.0,2024-07-05,United Kingdom 
R10KASEWYXZCSH,I like that it is a fan. It has 4 varying speeds. It occilates and the bottom is easy to assemble. It's light. It looks and feels quality. It's tall so the amount of fan air you get is a lot. It isn't uncomfortable for it to blow the air on you. It also preforms really well....However I had to return it because although it does hit you with the fan air... In heatwave British weather I don't feel cooler.

R1EIREYWFIEEEM,"This is a good fan but I went and bought the Dreo T3 after buying this one and would rate the T3 more than this one. Only because the opening 'window' where it actually blows out air is quite short and is not the full height of the grills. The T3 has a larger window and an extra speed setting and even though they are both stated as having 7.3m/s top speed, the T3 feels stronger than this one.

Some people who leave reviews seem to have an agenda, but most can be taken to be genuine; this one is the latter. Easy to assemble and was very surprised to feel the power of the air flow on level 1, which I think will be enough for my needs, but reassuring to know that there are much more powerful options, should they be required. As mentioned in the description it is almost silent on level 1 and very acceptable at higher airflow. Love all the different options and the sleep mode in particular. We don't get many times in the UK when a fan becomes essential, but I can see that this will be invaluable when that time comes.

It kept me and my family cool at night in our bedroom through the heatwave, and we've used it since to speed the drying and clearing of paint fumes when decorating.

But, I’m disappointed.The height is what disappoints me most, as you can’t use this as a bedside fan - you just can’t feel the effect of it.It should have more settings for choice of fan speed for the price. With this in mind, I would also at least expect to have a remote you can use in the dark!However, I really like the sleek design of the upright tower fan and the fan itself is powerful (albeit too short).

When the fan is switched off at the wall whilst running it doesn’t remember it was running when switched back on again and just turns on to standby mode. So won’t work with a smart switch.

R2QBBDRVA7S0DM,"The Crucial X9 Pro 1TB Portable SSD is, well, an external hard drive. It performs the function of storing data, and it does it adequately. There's not much else to say.In terms of design, it's a black rectangular box. It's not an eyesore, but it's not winning any design awards either. The build quality seems fine – no complaints there. The size is standard for a portable SSD, which I guess is good if that's what you're looking for.Setting it up is a breeze. Plug it in, and it works. No complicated software or fancy features to navigate. It's a storage device, after all.Now, let's talk about speed. It transfers files quickly. I copied some files, and they were copied fast. I don't know the exact speed, but it was fast enough for my needs. So, that's a plus.One thing I appreciate is the storage capacity. 1TB is a decent amount of space, and it suits my basic storage needs. I don't know about its durability or long-term performance, but I guess time will tell.In terms of value for money, it's alright. There might be cheaper options out there, but this one does the job.

R1I23XC3YKMFO7,"This small SSD is a great add-on for a Mac to edit 4K videos, store a library of RAW images or provide you with a Time Machine backup.It achieves respectable speeds (915MB/s write & 917.5MB/s read, when I tested it). In theory v10 goes faster but current-day Macs don't support the USB connection required. So unless you spend much more on a Thunderbolt enabled drive or special enclosure, this is going to be as good as you can currently get.The cable provided is short, but that can also be a benefit if you don't want wires all over the place. It also suits the device's use as a portable drive for modern USB-C fitted mirrorless cameras or the latest iPhones if you plan to shoot in the new log mode.The Mac version of the drive is colour-matched to Mac hardware and comes preformatted to work out of the packet. It's about £10 more expensive than the standard v9 drive, so I think you're paying extra for the convenience of not reformatting it plus the aesthetics. You also get 1mth free access to the full range of Adobe Creative Cloud apps, if that appeals.Finally, as someone who previously purchased the metal enclosed G-drives, it's remarable how small and light this feels.

So not quite the 1050 max advertised, but not too shabby.As a guide, I was able to run moderately sized Logic Pro and Cubase projects directly off the Seagate at speeds of 450Mbs, so I'm more than confident, that this new drive will be up to similar tasks.Final Cut Pro was a struggle for the Seagate, so I will have to see how the Crucial fares there.One thing to watch out for with the Crucial is (i guess due to its physical size and larger storage size capacity), is that it does run quite hot.I'd be interested how that affects its overall longevity.But all-in-all, a decently fast, super conveniently small sized external SSD, which unless you want to step up to the cost of aa M.2 drive and compatible, quality chipset enclosure, still presents fantastic value for money.",1.0,2024-09-04,United Kingdom

R2VOKTEPMPLUMZ,"I use this for backups of large photo and video files. It seems to work very well for that. My other corresponding backup device is a Sandisk Extreme (with the same 2TB capacity).I tested the comparative write speeds by copying a chosen folder on the internal SSD of my fairly fast Windows PC to each external SSD in turn. In a competely like-for-like comparison the Crucial X9 Pro had a steady transfer rate of ~550 MB/s (first picture - I just happened to do that screen-grab when it had momentarily dipped to 522 MB/s). In contrast, the Sandisk Extreme had a time-varying write speed which settled at a somewhat choppy ~370 MB/s (second picture).So, the sustained write speed of the Crucial X9 Pro appears to be about half as fast again as the Sandisk Extreme. In all other respects the Crucial X9 Pro and Sandisk Extreme are broadly similar, although the former is somewhat smaller physically. I deliberately chose two different drives as my backup devices, so that any issues which affected some/all instances of a given model wouldn't impact both of my backup copies. If I had to buy only one, I would choose the Crucial X9 Pro over the Sandisk Extreme.",5.0,2024-10-24,United Kingdom

However, I have knocked 1~1/2 stars off because of Crucial's decision to use a soft rubbery back; this is unnecessary, their intention was to make them more slide proof ? Unfortunately I have found this backing to pin hole showing the metal underneath which aesthetically spoils the the item. I wish manufacturers would not do this.  ~ It's the same with some 'Tablets' that you buy, they have this rubbery backing which produces permanent  unsightly marks over a period of time.

R18X0LM37SOI3F,"£205 at time of review Crucial X9 Pro 4TBUPDATE: almost a year later, and daily use still working perfectly, honestly can't recommend this enough, 6 stars!!!!Original ReviewFellow Mac users, don't fool for the marketing, the two versions are identical (just a slight colour difference, the internals are IDENTICAL), it simply comes APFS formatted initially rather than ExFat! So just get the non Mac version & reformat it as APFS as soon as you get it and you're good to go! If you're considering the X10 version (which is also fantastic), you'll only benefit from the extra speed if you have Thunderbolt 3 and above, so if you don't have that and don't need the extra speed get this, it's pretty incredibleThis has a premium build and finish, all metal enclosure, and as you’d expect it’s fast too. It comes formatted as ExFat, I’m a MacBook Pro M1 user so reformatted it to APFS, which is worthwhile if you’re in a Mac only environment, as the Blackmagic speed tests attest… ExFat R855 W920 vs APFS R925 W928.Next was to use Carbon Copy Cloner, to replicate my Sandisk Extreme 2TB, it took 49 mins to copy 1.65GB, both disks got pretty warm in the processHaving owned a Crucial X8 2TB previously, which was fantastic, never let me down, but annoyingly whilst on location I gave it to a client, who never returned it, although they paid for a replacement so I purchased a SanDisk Extreme 2TB… which was also very good until one day having sat on a shelf for months I plugged it in and it simply never responded, totally dead (I’m sure you’ve read the horror stories online about the Sandisk Extreme bad batch, yep I had one of those!), yes they replaced it no questions asked but I’m not getting burnt like that again, so hello Crucial my old friend!Just get it, you won't regret itHope my review was helpful",5.0,2023-11-08,United Kingdom 
R3E7H3WSPB6ET8,Very small in size but well made and maintains its speed.  As far as I can tell the difference between the X9 and the X9 Pro is its ability to keep going.  I used Blackmagic Speed Test and hit a reliable 950 average for read and write using a MacBook Pro M2When I compare that result to another external SSD that slowed down considerably after less than one minute.  So if you need constant speed for rapid file read writes the Pro is the version to go for.,5.0,2024-11-21,United Kingdom 
R16NJ5X9X5EHHN,"Frist impressions are great. Its crazy small. I knew the device was small. But it was until it was in my hand that I realise. It is similar size to a small matchbox, but half its height. I got the 1TB version. And no doubt the 2 or 4TB versions are no different by the looks of it.When I compare my small passport 4TB drive to this, the mypassport drive is now very clunky looking. Sign of the times.Top is a little slippery. However, the base has a nice thin rubbery feel that gives it some grip, so unlikely to slip off your fingers.Speed:USB C 3.1 on its own is the 10 Gbps or 1250MB/s maximum theoretical limit.Achieved transfer at 600MB/s with medium files size, directly or across a USB Hub. Around about 50% of max.Copying these files within the laptop's SSD drive, I achieve avg 350-400MB/s. Copying off drive, you'd expect some gain, so achieving 600MB/s is pretty reasonable.I imagine that will well be the laptop's own SSD drive read speed limit.Realistically, for external transfer, I went from 35MB/s to 600MB/s.

I like the fact it has flat sides/edges - so you can stack them easily on shelves, for example. It is very lightweight - you wouldn't even notice it in a bag/camera case etc.Under normal use, it has stayed around the 37C mark for temperature, so it stays quite cool.As for speed, I noticed, like some other reviewers, that the speed was around the 450 MB/s mark using Crystal Disk Mark, but that was when I had it attached to the ""standard"" USB-C port on my laptop. I now have it attached to the Thunderbolt 4 port instead, and I am indeed getting around 1050 MB/s (via a hub that is rated to 10 Gbps - theoretically, a maximum of 1250 MB/s).

After the PC had been restarted, although it still recognised the SSD as an additional drive, it no longer recognised any storage and had become unusable. Furthermore, the PC instantly started operating extremely slowly which led up to multiple crashes. These immediately ceased and the PC went back to normal upon disconnecting the external SSD. Have no intention of risking further damage to PC due to use of it and have requested a refund.Overall I imagine this particular one I received being faulty is a one-off so others may have better luck with it but nonetheless, it has left a bad impression and I cannot in good faith give higher than a one star because of that.

R364I7F9JXO9TO,"I wanted an external SSD to transfer literally thousands of photos and videos dating back 20 years and stored on much older external mechanical hard drives.I initially ordered the Sandisk Extreme 2TB drive, but when I tried to transfer a folder containing 1.3 TB to it, the speed was OK, but within a few minutes the drive got extremely hot (but continued working ok) but then after 2 hours it disconnected itself completely halfway through the transfer.I then Googled the problem and saw that some other users had experienced the same thing, so I ordered the Crucial X9 Pro instead.During the transfer of the same 1.3 TB folder, the X9 just got mildly warm to the touch, and completed the job without a problem.I also have older Samsung T7 drives, which have never given a problem and transferred the same folder without difficulty, albeit about 20% slower than the Crucial, and running a little bit warmer.The speed of both the Sandisk and Crucial were about the same: the long transfer time was due to the 15 year old hard drive they were transferring from.And although the Sandisk started working again when I clicked on it after the self-disconnection, I didn't want the stress of wondering if it would conplete a big transfer overnight without me sitting watching it. So the Sandisk Extreme has gone back and I’ll stick with the Crucial. In fact have ordered a couple more because I have so many historic files to preserve for prosperity.

R2TE8GM2R9A7UD,"Our old wooden shed had long since seen its best days so we spent sometime emptying it, moving the contents to our garage and dismantling it for the tip. We then settled on this new Keter shed (6x8) as it was the same size as our old one and had decent reviews too.We read the reviews and watched some YT videos before starting. Firstly, I would say assemble it on a dry day and not too windy. Despite checking the weather beforehand we were hit with some strong winds and downpours throughout the afternoon which delayed us a little. It certainly takes 2 people to build, even if the only thing the other person does is to support the panels during assembly. My wife and I, both in our 60s, took from 10am to 6pm to fully build this - but as I said we were hampered a little by the weather.OK onto the build itself. Its quite straightforward to erect, but these are some of my tips that may help others:1. There are a lot of screws, and I mean a lot - different shapes and uses. So make sure your drill batteries are fully charged before commencing. I got through 2 full batteries throughout the day.2. The instructions are constantly reminding you to make sure the panels are fully in the grooves when building. So I used a nylon hammer to tap the edges to ensure everything was completely together before screwing parts together, even after each screw, just making sure everything stayed together. Tap tap tap constantly.3. Some of the screws were self-drilling for connecting the metal parts. When there was a guide hole this was straightforward but some were difficult to get to bite. So I a few times I had to drill a small pilot hole to get the screw in.4. The dreaded roof. Getting the roof on is the most difficult part, but as long as all panel connections are snug as previously mentioned it shouldn't be too hard. When connecting the trims to the roof I had to make sure the 4 smaller pieces were tapped down as far as possible to the edge. If they are too central they will catch on the cross member of the roof and it won't fit. After I did this the roof went on quite easily - oh and the puck was really useful for this bit and the only time I really used it.All in all it's a great shed and fits perfectly where our old shed used to be (6x8). We just have to put all our stuff back in now.",5.0,2024-04-20,United Kingdom 
R2TA9IIXG26VPG,"Finally we have replaced our older wooden shed with this one. Hopefully it will outlast that. Time will tell.The shed has arrived in a huge box. Nearly 80kg. Luckily there was no damage parts in the box. Everything was well labeled and the instruction booklet was straight forward. I have already prepared myself and download it before.It was like assembling an IKEA stuff. Some bags contain extra screws!You need a drill, ladder/step, tape measure, maybe a rubber hammer and a lot of patience. To be accurate, for two people 6 and half hour. During that time you will find yourself saying f...ck many times.Most hardest part of the work is to assemble the floor and the roof and maybe one or two wall that has bent over a bit.The quality looks OK but after the installation I have already seen area that has not been perfect even we tried everything and measured a dozen of times. Such as:One side of the roof has a little curved.The long inside beam under the peak of the roof is not clipped in properly therefore we could not screwed in the forth screw. Maybe that is why the little curve in one side of the roof.One of the door is not leveled properly so it catches the bottom of the shed just a couple of mm.The air ventilators has no indoor parts. It is just clicks into but I do not feel secure. And indoor part with some net would have been better option to avoid bugs goes in.The floor does not look that sturdy. It already has a small section where it shows a tiny bit compression damage after we walked on it.There was a couple of screws I could not screw in without drill into the designated hole because behind, there is metal.Even with these minor issues I still think it worth the money. I hope it will not develop dump as our wooden shed.As I have mentioned earlier, time will tell how it holds up.A quick tip for the end: When you put the window in, do not remove the foil from it. It looks much nicer, still lets the light in plus it gives privacy to the shed.",4.0,2023-04-09,United Kingdom

We were one hour building the body of the shed and three hours fitting the roof. Every time you get three corners fitted one pops off as you align the fourth. We gave up following the instructions and screwed in opposite corners e.g left corner then right top corner. We also wedged with wood under the bottom of the walls on the other corners as we worked and then removed them when the roof was fully screwed to the walls. This was successful.

R39335D3PV9HQN,"Very complex assembly instructions and in practice; doing it on my own except for lifting the roof on it took me 4 weekends.  The edge mouldings for the floor (1st step), & the roof, were the hardest to get to stay in place; the instructions make you fit the frame upside down & then turn the whole thing over ….  WHY ??It defeats me utterly why the floor & roof sections couldn’t be produced in one piece at the factory with their edges in place, it wouldn’t affect the package size.The walls, corners, window & door were easy to work out (Aluminium door-frame helps with its shape); but I used extra screws on the window-frame.  Again why isn’t the window sold in its frame, & why don’t the doors come with their stiffening edges moulded-on ???  You need a degree in AI to work out which door is which and where to drill them for the hinges etc.  The paper stick-on labels do help a bit with Top, Bottom, L & R; or inside / outside - but why not sell them Pre-drilled …. ??The roof edgings would not fit onto the tops of the wall panels except on one side - I had to buy some lengths of thick plastic trim about 12 cm wide x 0.5 cm thick and pre drill them, & use them to fix the roof edging inners to the metal inserts in the wall panel tops from inside the shed.  This worked and its in use & sturdy & difficult to spot the mods !But what a faff !!  These are made where there must be a culture of not making things too easy for yourself !!I had a smaller KETER shed a few years ago & it just popped together in no time …..I bought this because the make I ordered originally, which was £200 cheaper never arrived, got refund, but no one else was selling that one at a reasonable price.I’m perfectly happy with it, it’s a shed after all, now it’s up (& it won’t rot or rust !)It helps if you’re very handy, have a comprehensive tool kit and space to lay things out in the area.  A cordless power drill & screwdriver is vital.  Some of the bolts and self drilling screws were not present in the right quantities & some had too many; but I couldn’t be bothered contacting the supplier for extras, I just adapted the design using some I had anyway.If I ever move house again, it’s STAYING !!!",3.0,2023-05-20,United Kingdom 
R1XFMZXXMPIU0G,"Base and walls were relatively easy to put together. Roof was a pain and needed three people at one point. Building on a level surface is important.We were building into a corner so wouldn't be able to get the screws into the hidden sides, but the whole thing is just light enough that you can move it around while its empty and slide it to where you need it.The floor is pretty squishy - anything heavy will dent and flatten it, anything sharp will pierce it. We had a sheet of 12mm OSB spare so trimmed it to fit. You probably want to price this in if you're going to be storing tools, gardening equipment, freestanding shelf units etc.Since putting this up a couple of weeks ago we've had plenty of rain and some of the worst storms in decades but the shed has held up fine.What I'd do different next time -1. Only put in enough screws to hold it together until you can get the roof on. There were sections that looked level but would clash when the roof went on. I ended up taking 3/4 of the screws out, re-jigging it, then putting all the screws back in once it was where it needed to be. Thankfully the plastic is pretty forgiving.2. Add the roof trim to the roof panel but don't screw it down until its on the base. If you align and screw the roof trim on first, to where you think it needs to be, it will likely not align with the base. Keep it loosely fitted, lift the roof on, align the roof trim to the base walls so it all fits, then secure the trim to the roof and the walls below. Because access will now be tricky you'll need a right-angle drill bit to do it this way.",4.0,2022-02-21,United Kingdom

R2GPABS09RJ2EG,"I ordered the assembly option on this shed, which would have been great value if it had worked out. Amazon for reasons unknown scheduled delivery with a courier that did not offer assembly. Due to the time constraints of my project I decided to put it together myself.The instructions are pretty good - you need to be well versed in self assembly if you are going to take this on.  There are a lot of steps and screws, a powered screwdriver is an essential.  I'm certain a timber shed could be assembled more quickly. I found a rubber mallet handy to tap the panels into the edges (be gentle if you do this as the edges of the panels aren't meant for this).  I managed to do everything on my own up until the installation of the roof beam and roof itself. That part is certainly a 2 person job. It was *extremely* fiddly getting the roof edges to fit into the top of the shed walls, much messing about with the little plastic spatula thingamy they supply, without which the job would be nigh on impossible. When fitting the window it was handy to have someone on the outside to hold the panel in place while putting the screws in.If you slip with your screwdriver expect it to go through the outer layer of the walls :-( Not tough enough in my opinion.The kit doesn't include any fixings to attach the shed to the base, probably this is because they don't know what kind of base you are going to use, but go grab these before you start to save an extra trip to the DIY shop.",3.0,2023-06-12,United Kingdom

Again not easy . The instructions are not well explained.  All 3 of them said that . My husband is pleased with the results though . With the roof the instructions were abandoned and they followed their own instincts to put it on. It went on easier that way . It was a worry the shed wasn't going to be completed must admit . The floor is quite flimsy.  My husband put a shed grid base down first and filled with stones and gravel . The base is very deep. Apparently that has made the flooring more substantial.

R2JX7S6V9FYQ0T,"I already have a Keter shed (6' x 6') I bought nearly 10 years ago. I'm really impressedhow easy it was to install then. Never had to do anything to the shed in the 10 yearsand still standing strong and upright!I needed a new shed, (The old wooden one 8' X 6' which was 14 years old was falling to bits and there was only one shed I wanted - Keter. I am really surprised how much they had increased in price over the 10 years but they're such a good shed still so worth every penny!Delivery from Amazon was really fast, within 2 weeks. I had time to prepare the base it was being built on. I decided on 3' x 2' slabs (9 in total) laid on a bed of sand. They all levelled up well and square.The shed arrived on the Wednesday and I started immediately (on my own) to construct it. This went really well, follwing the instructions was a doddle, everything lined up. A bit of drilling was needed, but by mid afternoonit was almost complete.My neighbour assisted with the roof which went on and fixed down really quickly. everything was fixed down with screws as per the instructions. The shed is in a bit of a confined space but I was able to work on it with no problems.The next day I spent putting all my tools, mower etc in the new shed.I really don't have any complaints about how the construction went, so long as the base is flat and level it will all go together easy.The test was with the impending storm 'Ellen' (late August 2020) which had winds of over 60mph during the week. Needless to say the Keter shed stayed dry inside and intact. I'm really pleased and would thoroughly recommend to anyone that if you are in the market for a garden shed then seriously consider a Keter. Just to add, I am giving an honest appraisal of this shed and in no way am I being sponsored or under any obligation to Keter themselves.",5.0,2020-08-23,United Kingdom 
RYSM5FZEGDIOP,So glad we didn’t pay full price for this shed.  We had no idea that it would be corrugated plastic and not solid plastic walls.  It was over 8 hours of assembly with two people needed for the roof.  It’s hard to get it all aligned up and we ended up breaking the corner plastic pieces in the process (we do hope to get replacements).  Floor is very thin and ended up with divers in it on the first day.  We ended up buying vinyl floor tiles to lay over it for added durability.  Just wasn’t anything like we expected in a keter product.  We hope it will stand up to the warranty.,3.0,2024-04-09,United Kingdom

The only difficult bits were putting the roof on and securing it in place, but once you find the knack it all goes together well.The sturdiness is more than I was expecting and once anchored to the patio slab base should be ok, but I think I will look at putting some anchor straps from one side, over the top to the other side, just as extra insurance.",4.0,2022-06-22,United Kingdom

It’s a very big piece that is very difficult to manoeuvre.If you don’t have an adult male to help, you won't succeed.Once the roof was on the rest was ok.The self drill screws are diabolical. Why Keter won’t pre drill holes in the metal bars is beyond my comprehension.Overall the shed is pretty. It’s not sturdy and I probably won’t buy another one like this.

In places it slots together like a dream and then other parts taking an absolute age and lots of trial and error. There’s a fair few screws that need to go in to metal but there are no pilot holes so you’ll have to drill them yourself. We could not get the roof to line up for love nor money  so it’s fixed firmly in places and very badly in others.You most certainly can’t store anything valuable in here as I could easily pop the doors open if I wanted to and anyone with a screwdriver can remove the hinges or bolt but I guess that’s a flaw of any shed.I’m happy with the purchase but with a few tweaks from Keter it could be so much better.,4.0,2020-05-23,United Kingdom

RUA1Y7VFKNWCI,"I have purchased from Keter before and was very pleased with the shed, so I didn't hesitate to buy again. Did I ever make a mistake!!!!!!. The plastic used in the construction was so thin I had reservations from the beginning. I am disabled but did start to erect the shed myself. Right from the beginning, items didn't line up and the panel with the aperture for the window had been cut lopsided. In frustration I hired a man to come and finish it but near the end it became obvious the doors were not going to hang straight so we gave it up for a bad job. We contacted Amazon Customer Services, explained our situation and it was though the guy wasn't listening, we thoroughly explained our problems, his first offer was 20% refund but we could keep a completely unusable shed. The second option was that we could dismantle the shed and pay to have it returned but by now I had an accident in which I had broken my arm and was completely unable to do anything. The option settled on was that the shed would have to be dismantled at our cost and Amazon would arrange for it to be picked up. So we found ourselves out of pocket to have a shed that was faulty erected then diassembled and although it has not been collected I anticipate that a driver will arrive expecting it to be neatly repackaged in its box ( which went to recycling) and will refuse to collect the item. The whole episode has been a debacle which has left us some £100 out of pocket and very angry with Amazon, my husband and I are O.A.P's and both disabled and Amazon have been as much help as.....well NOTHING.

The tool included to tuck the panels into the uprights and roof looked as though it wouldn’t do anything, but actually it was really effective.  The doors were not closing properly at first, but by checking that all the screws were tight, the structure squared up and the doors closed correctly.  We bought some thin jigsaw mats to cover the floor to protect it, and cut them to size.  It’s a very sturdy, good looking shed.  Very weatherproof.",5.0,2021-12-31,United Kingdom

Once erected, and it's definitely a two person operation, the shed itself is reasonably sturdy and certainly waterproof as the torrential downpours of the past few days have proven.  The double door fits and works well, but provides virtually no security whatsoever as any with a screwdriver will be able to remove the hinges within seconds!.  The sides are however very flimsy and there is no way anything can be attached to them internally, so any additional stand alone shelving etc needs to be very stable - No shelving is provided!

R2NHME2FA5S8A,"We bought the EcoFlow Delta 2 bundle to enable us to go off grid in the motorhome, to use as backup power in the home should there be a power failure, to run the fridge freezer, microwave and kettle and to use to run power tools when necessary.The Ecoflow Delta 2 is an extremely well made, compact portable solar power generator weighing in at 12KG with a 3000 cycle and has the versatility of being able to be charged by the solar panels included in this bundle or by being plugged into the mains for a quick charge.  The Delta 2 has the capability of expanding the power output by adding one or two extra batteries. A further 220w solar panel can also be added if wanted.There  are multiple output ports, including 4 x 230-240v plug sockets, different types of USB ports as well a 12v cigarette lighter type socket which we used to run a 12v TV and an Amazon fire stick ran off a USB socket. We also charged mobile phones and iPads and ran a fan and lights in the hot weather. We use low wattage travel kettle and toaster in the motorhome which didn’t prove a problem.We went away for 4 days in the motorhome off grid for the first time using the Delta 2 power generator to provide all the power we needed while we were away.  The Delta 2 performed brilliantly and we only used the solar panel, which is very easy to set up, to top the generator up to full capacity once which only took a couple of hours. The power generator  provided more than enough power for what we needed for the 4 days we were off grid.Connecting the 220w solar panel to the Delta 2 was very easy, simply connecting the solar panel to the power generator with the cables provided.  The solar panel is clipped to the opened carry bag which is used to stand the solar panel at an angle to catch the sun for charging.We were very impressed with the build quality, versatility, power output and ease of use of the compact Ecoflow Delta 2 and the 220w solar panel.  All the necessary cables including a cigarette type socket cable for charging the unit in the car while driving are provided in the kit.We also bought the Ecoflow Delta 2 generator waterproof bag for extra protection for the unit which has a zippered pouch on the top to store the cables.Some people have complained that the Delta 2 is very noisy when the fan kicks in to cool the batteries, we did not find it any more noisy than the little desk fan we use in the motorhome, certainly nothing to complain about, it did not bother us while watching a movie nor did it disturb our sleep.Overall we are very impressed and pleased with our purchase and with the assistance provided by the Ecoflow team who answered various questions we asked.  So impressed we have bought an extra Delta battery to increase our power capacity allowing us to go off grid for a lot longer without worrying about running out of power.  Delivery was within a few days of purchase by 2 separate couriers who were both very helpful putting the boxes inside the door for me.",5.0,2024-06-27,United Kingdom 
RVWJ3NYPQNLXD,"This is an amazing piece of kit that requires a detailed review !Having recently heavily researched Solar power generation due to the massive increase in energy prices i decided to spend some of my hard earned cash in this technology to see how well it performed.I initially purchased a 537wh Bluetti EB55 along with a 200w solar panel.  Whilst this performed well i was disappointed at how quickly the battery drained with medium draw appliances, and the fact the Bluetii display was information poor, ie no exact battery percentage or estimated time of power draw left. I also only wanted a LiFePO4 battery due to the serviceable life of these batteries (3000+ Charges/Cycles)  compared with standard lithium ion batteries which are only around 800 cycles. The market was very limited for these type of devices, hence why i choose the mid-range bluetti.  I did rush into this purchase and kind of regret now understanding watt hours and power draw.After a few days of use and a lot more research it did get me hooked on the future of this technology and the fact i could harvest free energy from the sun.  As a direct result of my first experiment i did some more research and found that ECOFLOW were releasing a LiFePO4 generator - so i decided to invest some serious cash in the Ecoflow Delta 2 and pre-ordered.The ECOFLOW Delta 2 is a lot bigger than my Bluetti, however it does have around twice the battery capacity and additional power outlets. When it arrived my first impressions was that this was a very well built premium bit of kit.  Turning on the device i noticed that it was around 38% charged so i immediately connected it to my 200w solar panel. The day was fairly cloudy was intermittent brief sun, after a few hours i managed to get the battery up to the mid 50's.  I wanted to test this device with 100% storage power so decided to connect it to my house mains to charge the remainder of the battery.  Although i never intend to charge this via mains electricity i wanted to test the quick charging functionality for emergencies.  The first thing that i liked about this over the Bluetti was that there was no external charging brick (that's a huge drawback for me when i do a direct comparison)  the Delta 2 just has a standard kettle lead which you plug directly into the unit and the mains.  Within a couple of seconds of doing this the fans for the unit kicked in - wow they are loud and powerful.  I have uploaded a video of this so you can see how loud this thing is when AC charging.  The unit drew between 1kw and 1.2kw of electricity from the grid, and wow this thing can charge fast!  0-80% in 50 mins! As i already had over 50% charge it didn't take long to reach 100% capacity - the unit lowers the charging rate +80%, and the fans slow down somewhat - but you can definitely still hear them. When charging via Solar the fans were not nearly as loud. You have an option in the app (more about that later) which allows you to limit the AC Charging rate, which in turn should lower the fans. Included with the device is an MPPT to 12v car charger so you can also charge this device from your vehicle.Now for the power test!  I wanted to see if this unit could power my UST Projector, and if so how long for.  Plugging in my projector the display showed a power draw of 312w, this meant i would be lucky to get 3hrs from the unit which wasn't ideal.  I therefore lowered the brightness of my projector down to 50% and this increased the draw time to 5.5hrs.  I was super happy with that! We used the unit all evening to watch TV on our projector and the battery was down to 7% - i was super impressed.Over the next few days i did a ton of more tests on this device and all impressed me. I loved the fact that the display showed me the exact battery percentage, the power draw from the devices and the remaining time.  Using the USB sockets on the front of the device i was able to charge all of our smaller gadgets like phones/iPad's etc.  I even asked my partner to power their two work laptops from the Delta 2, this also worked fantastically.  With lower powered devices you could get several days use out of the Delta 2.  A rough calculation of the usage time compared to the 1024kwh battery worked out to around 84% during my real word tests - this is relatively standard across the battery generator range when allowing for Inverter draw and displays/wifi etc.  The Delta 2 also has pass through charging which allows you to solar charge and draw power at the same time.Over the weekend we had some fantastic sun, and all of my Delta 2 energy was drawn from my solar panels - i have now upgraded to two panels to increase the charging times.  The Delta 2 at it's peak was drawing +300w from my panels in bright sunshine.  The charging time for this was showing around 3.5hrs.  I am confident in the summer months i could easily draw 1kw and fill the batteries in just one day of sun.The device has 4 x 3 pin UK AC Sockets on the rear, along with the MC4 solar input connection and the AC Kettle plug for AC charging.  Here you will also find a reset button should you ever need to use it. Also on the rear is a 12v cigarette input and 2 x DC5521 barrel inputs.  On the front of the device is a lovely crystal clear LCD display which shows you a wealth of information such as time to charge remaining, time of discharge remaining, watts in and watts out and a very clear battery percentage.  You also have 2 standard USB a sockets 5v 2.4a 12W max, 2 USB A Fast Charging Sockets 5V, 2.4A / 9V, 2A / 12V, 1.5A, 18W Max, and two USB C sockets 5/9/12/15/20V, 5A, 100W Max which support super fast charging.  The USB C sockets are powerful enough to use and charge my laptops at the same time.  Each group of inputs has an individual on/off button to switch on that part of the inverter.  Individual control is better as this will save unnecessary battery drain.Another huge benefit of owning this device is that it is also Bluetooth and Wi-Fi compatible.  You need to download the free ECOFLOW app and this allows you to see input/output rates on your phone even when you are away from home/the device - it's basic but works well.  I loved the fact i could be at work and check the solar wattage going into the device!  It was kind of addicted.  The app can sometimes mess up and not update correctly, but i am hoping this can be fixed in a software/firmware update - which incidentally can be sent to the DELTA 2 via your phone/tablet!The DELTA 2 can handle devices up to 1800w with a surge boost of up to 2400w.  This enables this device to power pretty much any standard electrical appliance plugged into it and it will work, albeit perhaps at a lower wattage if the appliance likes this, ie heat guns etc. The device also has a built in UPS so that if your mains powers goes out then the device will switch over to carry on powering your devices - it does have a few milliseconds' delay (unlike my purpose UPS device) but for most electronic equipment this should be fine. It also output a true sinewave, so sensitive appliances like computers etc would be fine with the Delta 2's power supply.Solar input maxes out at 500w. You need to be super careful if you are connecting this to multiple solar panels though so that you do not go over the voltage which maxes out at 60V 15A.  Before you invest in solar panels always check the Open Circuit Voltage (OSV) of the panel to ensure it is within the range of 11-60v, one panel will be fine but adding multiple panels can take you close to this range if not over - you should always allow a 20% threshold too for cold sunny days.  Working out solar compatibility is a bit of a minefield, but after weeks of research i believe i now understand the basics.  To help you if you connect two or more solar panels in parallel with a Y adapter then the voltage of the panels remains the same but the amps are added together, if however you connect in series (positive to negative leaving only two MC4's) then you need to add the voltage of all your panels together and the amps/current remains the same.  Thus, be super careful not to exceed the specs of the Delta 2 or you could seriously damage it.So in summary would i recommend this device - without hesitation YES!  This technology is still super expensive, however it is an absolutely amazing product i really wish i had found this product before i purchased my Bluetti - it excels the Bluetii in every single way!  To generate free electricity from the sun is fantastic, but to store it to use later is beyond amazing.  This little guy does it all and does it very well... excellent storage capacity at just over 1kw of electricity (Around 28p at time of writing this review) truly portable - weights around 12kg, but has great handles to distribute the weight evenly, you can even add the battery expansion pack to take this up to over 3KW!  Firmware updates are provided via the app to the device so it stays current, fantastic detailed display which is easy to read even in sunlight, great phone app, fantastic selection of power ports, fast solar charging, super fast AC charging, expandable up to 3kw with the additional battery pack,  8.2yrs of daily charging before battery depletes to 80% capacity & to top that ECOFLOW offer a full 5yr guarantee.  I honestly can not recommend this product enough if you want to invest in a small solar energy setup - purchase cost to payback would work out at around 10yrs (excluding solar panels and wiring) with current energy prices at 0.28p per KWh, however this isn't all about money, this device is about emergency power, portable power (camping etc) being more green and protecting the environment.  I genuinely love this product and wish i had purchased this before i wasted money on my Bluetti.  I intend to save up to buy the add on battery pack... but rather disappointingly that may be a while yet!I hope that you found my review helpful.",5.0,2022-09-26,United Kingdom 
R2WGI8H1KYQFV5,"After researching different power stations, we decided to go with the EcoFlow DELTA 2.  We wanted something with a large power capacity, and something portable, for use in our motorhome, and have been testing it out over the last couple of months.

R2MF6DTN4LRS87,"This product is amazing! I am able to run my fridge/freezer, microwave & kettle from it (& another battery ie. 2kw) for around 24hrs. Pop it outside, attach to their portable solar panels in the morning & obviously dependant on the weather, but both units (power station & spare battery) are charged in roughly 4 hrs. During our 6 weeks of great weather earlier this year, i did this every day & gained enormous satisfaction, as well as saving a bit of money! I admit the power station i find a little heavy but it is only 12kgs & has sturdy handles at each end so easy to lift. The bifold solar panels get stiff when cold or not used, so they can be a bit of a faff to set up initially & will not go straight until warmed up. But then they work extremely well. To be able to pack them away neatly in their multi use storage bag when not in use, is worth the time & effort.Overall, this is in my view tge best product out there. It is so eady to use & so well though through & is beautifully designed. I bought it for two reasons,  firstly to run anything electrical in my polytunnel & secondly as a back up for the cottage power supply. I am delighted. Ive also used it to run a chop saw in the middle of a field to build a sheep shelter, a Dyson vacuum cleaner to clean the car in the barn& an iron to iron tablecloths in a marquee!).I chose the Delta 2 because of the extended life of the battery, despite actually wanting something with a higher kw storage.",5.0,2023-07-25,United Kingdom 
R10JPE3D4FFU6S,"I had put off in the past getting one of these 'power stations' as I felt they were not quite 'there'. Well I now feel they have finally got up to speed with this fantastic device! The number of different uses for the EcoFlow DELTA 2 is staggering! From workshop tool use, power supply backup, garden use to camping and motor homing this very clever device handles it all.I like the Bluetooth communication between the app you can install on your phone and the DELTA 2. You can keep an eye on all of the ins and outs of power and more using the app.Charging is a breeze with this Power Station with several options available including mains charging (very fast), Cigar socket while driving and Solar Panel (can use several different types) I actually charge mine while off grid in my motor home by plugging the car charging cigar cable plugged into a 12v cigar socket output from my leisure batteries which are in turn charged from my fixed solar panels on the roof, this works very well! When charging via 12v you can also choose charging input levels of 4, 6 and 8 amps so as to not over tax your 12v charging option.If I ever get the chance to try their extension battery which you can purchase to plug into the main unit to increase the amount of capacity I will post an honest review, but sadly I can not at this time afford the purchase.I would recommend this fantastic Power Station!",5.0,2023-08-21,United Kingdom 
R2YZI814UV03Y4,"Have had this (and the extra battery) for a couple of weeks now and have done some basic testing.I bought this as insurance against possible power cuts coming up this winter, and with the extra battery this should allow me to power a PC for 4 hours so that I can continue to work... or watch TV for a couple of days!Pros:  Came quickly, packaged nicely, seems sturdy. Display makes sense (once you've tried it in different configurations) and it's simple to use.  Just plug in your appliance(s) and press button on back and appliance works.  Plug ecoflow into wall, switch on and it charges.  Use the App and you can change the rate of charge.  All in all a simple operations.Annoyances:  First annoyance was opening the manual and seeing that the saftey instructions warn that if used to power a fridge then power fluctuations might cause the ecoflow to shut down. Thats obviously annoying since if power was off for any length of time the powering the fridge would be very useful. It also tells you to contact them if you have pacemakers, hearing aids, or implants before you use it.  Not a problem for me (yet) but seems like they should state that more clearly when purchasing!Charging noise:  It's very loud when charging - even when the charging rate is turned down to 200W.Running noise: When trialled with my TV at about 95W, the unit is silent for most of the time, but every 10-15 or so minutes the fans turn on for 30 seconds or so.  It's reasonably quiet and you can live with it, but obviously it would be nice if it was completely silent when pulling gentle loads.  In fact the the fan does go on and off even when nothing is being powered / charged.UPS capability: I've tried using the system as an UPS (e.g. ecoflow powered from mains and device powered from the ecoflow, so that if mains dies the device continues uninterrupted) to power flat screen TV plus BT box plus ethernet hub.  On switching off the mains, the BT box seemed not to notice, but the TV went into standby and then rebooted.  This means I'm not sure if I can use it as an ups for a PC (or two) and am wary of testing it out.  Perhaps getting a cheaper, low power UPS, to place between the ecoflow and pc might provide a high power UPS solution without costing the earth.Niggles:1. Whilst trialing this I put it next to my TV and found that turning the AC output on/off was really tricky since where I'd put it it was difficult to reach the AC on off button at the rear of the unit (epecially with the extra battery on top).  Be nice if that button was on the front.2. Why no timer? It would be useful to control when the ecoflow charges so that you can charge on an economy rate, or, as in my case, charge when Its likley my solar panels are producing excess power.  One way around this is to put a timer on the mains but it could have been useful it was in built.3. Why does the app need me to have bluetooth and location switched on?  Location burns my phone battery  and I have no love for any app that needs to track me so if so i want to use the ecoflow app I have to turn location on and then off afterwards.So when all is said and done, this is still a pretty amazing kit.  It is expensive but seems better value for money than other similar units.  Come the summer I will be able to charge it for free with my excess solar power, and hopefully find a suitable location for it to power stuff in the evening.  However I don't think I'll ever recover the cost of purchase, but it will be nice to be partially immune from power cuts.",4.0,2022-11-14,United Kingdom 
R3NHS55DXOU51E,"Review from an off-grid user based in the UK - power your CPAP using the sun!My primary use for this Portable Power Station was to power an NHS provided ResMed Air10 Autosense CPAP machine.  After extensive research I was still unsure as to which power station to go for until I contacted EcoRiver for their recommendation on which one would meet my needs.  They recommended this one - and being much more powerful and more expensive than the original one I was looking at I was initially a bit skeptical.  However this machine is the minimum you need to power your ResMed Air Sense 10 Autoset on AC power (it is more efficient to power it using the 12V DC to DC converter, available from ResMed, but as far as I know this option means the humidifier function on the CPAP machine does not work as it needs more than 12V).Using this machine I could power my CPAP machine on AC power, just like at home, for two nights without recharging, using the humidifier function.  However I used EcoRiver's excellent 400W solar panel (which I will review separately) to recharge it every day, meaning I had tons of extra power left over.  This machine can easily power a toaster or microwave and can even power a powerful mains powered GHD hairdryer for a short time.DOMESTIC KETTLES NO - TRAVEL KETTLES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS YES!It would NOT be able to power a domestic voltage AC kettle as these use typically 3000W for a short time - when off grid in my view you're better off using gas to boil water rather than a domestic kettle - though it will easily power travel kettles, full domestic power AC toasters, lower wattage travel toasters, and all manner of other gadgets.  It goes without saying that if you're planning to use lots of high wattage tools for a long time you will need an even bigger battery but for phones, tablets and laptops this machine more than has you covered.  At times during a recent camping trip it was fast-charging four phones simultaneously.SILENT CHARGING FROM THE SUN!Before I bought this device we had to rely on a petrol powered 1800W generator to recharge things and use a TV in the caravan, which is loud enough to be pretty antisocial not to mention the fumes.  Using this battery paired with a 400W EcoRiver solar panel provided free, silent power.  Even on heavily overcast days with light rain, the panel was still providing 40w input power, which would recharge the battery over 6-8 hours from 50% full.  In direct bright sunshine, the panel once recharged the battery from flat in two hours, which is an amazing amount of power.MAINS AC RECHARGING IN BAD WEATHER/WHEN MAINS POWER IS AVAILABLEThis battery can recharge off a normal mains AC outlet, drawing 1200w, in about 50 minutes, using the provided kettle-style lead.  Fairly loud fans kick in to cool it during this which is reassuring.  This was a great feature off-grid as during one period of intensely heavy rain and dense overcast lasting two days I ran the battery flat and was able to recharge it using the AC outlet of a petrol generator in less than an hour.This is an amazing piece of kit and the accompanying app for iPhone is very clear.  It was great to be able to check the solar charging was working well and how much power was flowing in and being used simultaneously.It is worth every penny.  Buy it.",5.0,2023-09-05,United Kingdom 
R2DE764TAVKJSL,"I am so pleased with this. I got it for two reasons, the main reason being for camping but I'm also a bit of a prepper, so this is ideal for both.So it powers my huge camping fridge and I can charge it using my 400w portable solar panels. Without the solar panels it will power my fridge for about three days. It can power my home fridge freezer for about two days.I like the amount of power outlet options.The app is very useful and offers me full control of the powerstation and really accurate and clear insight into it input and outputs. I like how i can choose how it charges quicker but louder or slower but quiet. I like how it can be charged by solar or outlet whilst having power going out too. It tells you exactly the output and input watts. Also altering it's charge and discharge limit. The app has a very user friendly interface. However, it's not necessary because the control pad on the device is pretty good. You can also turn the beeps off and also the screen to turn off, which is ideal when camping.The build quality is extremely good. I like the handles, they're sturdy. It's heavyish but maneuverable. I would recommend getting the case for the extra protection though and there is a pocket on the top to store the leads.",5.0,2024-11-22,United Kingdom 
R26A2P9HVABRFF,"This unit has surprised me, I was not sure if it would be powerful enough for the kit I needed to run of it - computer, three screens, router, speaker and a 500watt heater. It has coped very well with plenty of power to run it all minus the heater for most of the day and with the 400watt solar panel it runs it all for the day. The heater knocked it down to 1 hour, but with the solar (running at 250watts on average) it in fact lasted more than 2 hours - enough for my needs. However, as it is expandable, if I need the heater for longer I will just expand the system.The fan is silent when using less than 100watts (ie when everything is on standby) but when using the heater which draws 500watts the fan kicks in as is quite noisy.This unit is definitely value for money, well made, light enough to be portable, plenty of plug options. Would definitely recommend.",5.0,2024-11-01,United Kingdom 
R2CSU8OWGFFF38,"I’m now 4 weeks in using the Delta 2 and can truly say I’m impressed, the build quality is excellent,The ergonomics... The design of the handles makes it very easy to carry with the 2 big study handles, it’s very easy to carry with just one hand (just like you are carrying a heavy bag) the handles are comfortable in your hand. This is a portable power station and designed well for exactly this purpose.Charging of the unit... I have 2x410w solar panels in Rensol tubs (wired in parallel) on a first-floor flat roof, I can’t put solar panels on my 3 story house due to being in a conservation area but this seems to be just the right amount of power, pulling in 490+ watts in full direct sunlight(charging the battery fully in approx.2.5hrs .And still pulling in 70-90 watts in full cloud cover.  Charging from the mains takes approximately 1h 30m (rough estimates as have not precisely timed it)Powering Electrical appliances... I have Been testing this out, it will run the washing machine (1hr 34m cycle) 1400 spin at 30degree the unit only uses 29% battery so I can get 3 full cycles out of one charge. The washing machine has not used a single bit of grid power since my purchase.This dishwasher is a different matter, A 1hr 30m - 30–60-degree cycle it will use 91%, but on the bright side I now realize how much energy my dishwasher uses. When I get around to suppling solar to the kitchen it should breeze this if charging at the same time.It will run my air fryer (2400w Ninja AF400UK) one draw at 1200w but will throttle to 1800w with both draws going at the same time.  But still works fine.All above is done with X-Boost enabled.I now charge my electric bike (with solar) so my commutes are now free, saving money on fuel.Interface & Connectivity… The display is clear and simple giving only the relevant information needed… charge input and discharge estimate times, to get full use you must install the app, this is made very simple to install and link with the supplied instructions. This will then open lots of settings including updates.Pro’s… Will power almost any house appliance, good ergonomics easy to transport, charging from solar is fast, from AC even faster.  Excellent battery life cycles 3000 to 80% if you cycle it once day that would be 8.2 years, the app is easy to use. A 5year warranty when you register it. Also, there seem to be a very good community on social media.Cons’s… The fan is loud and kicks in, full tilt at only 200ish watts. Even when I feel the expelled air it is not that hot, so hopefully a firmware update could fix this in the future.Overall, I’m impressed with unit and still finding out how to best utilise the D2P and really chuffed with my purchase.",5.0,2023-08-21,United Kingdom 
R2ZWS73PJTH650,"Great device. Works well with what i use it for. But, and it's a big but, I'd advise if you want something like this then to find another company as frankly ecoflow have horrendous aftersales and their customer service is non existent.  Buyers beware.",4.0,2024-11-23,United Kingdom 
R3J0JCY62G9JH2,"I bought this power station for our VWT5 Van.  Power station is extremely portable, fairly light to carry in and out of the van.  This runs all the items we need in the van from all our phones, laptops and iPads.  We use this with a kettle, induction hob and portable heater.  It runs all of these items without any issues unlike other probable stations bought in the past.  Do not buy cheap make sure you save up and buy this one as all others are not worth it.  I made this mistake as was inpatient to get a portable station and decided to get a cheap one.  This was returned within 2 weeks as it stopped working and was a real problem to get my money back.  Once receiving this power station the customer service has been fantastic and any question you want to know will be answered within a day or two.  I wished I had enough money to get the Delta Max 2 which looks like a purchase for the future.  I bought a 100watt solar panel to charge the unit when at a campsite which isn’t made by EcoFlow but works wonderfully with this unit and produces far more watts than I anticipated.  I use this in the house when its not being used in the camper van to run our television and soundsystem this helps save a little money on our energy costs as I then just charge it up with the portable solar panel.  I would love to see how the eco flow solar panels work with this unit but need to save up some more money to purchase these.  If I do purchase them I will give them an honest review.  The only downside to the unit if I was picky is that the fan noise when charging more than 500 watts or using anything more than 500 watts is quite loud.  It’s not unbearable but is something to note.  I think EcoFlow have a fantastic product and I’m sure they will produce even more great products in the future.",5.0,2023-09-01,United Kingdom

RKKSDC8WU9CSP,"After researching the numerous varieties of power stations, I chose to purchase the EcoFlow Delta because it fitted my requirements.I liked its design, the clear digital display, the size and shape and the fact it was light to carry at 12kg as weight was very important.I have tested it fully with using it to charge multiple phones, smart watches and toothbrushes at the same time whilst camping. I also used it to power my air fryer and my induction hob which I was surprised it could power. Yes the induction hob drained its power but enabled me to cook a meal easily when the camping has run out.When I charged the Delta 2 from the mains power it was charged in under 90 minutes…. Another tick in the box.I am impressed by the App  you can download for your mobile phone/tablet that you can use to monitor or control it, either through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for easy convenience is great, along with the 5 year warranty (you must register online) is a definite selling pointI use the Delta 2 for camping, in the motorhome, in the shed and It is a great convenient power source, as well as peace of mind if needed during a power cut.I am extremely pleased with my purchase and have used  it every weekend since purchasing.Overall, a very impressive power station, which I would highly recommend and friends are now interested after having seen it in use and after hearing our feedback on our purchase.",5.0,2023-11-05,United Kingdom 
R3KBVL6BQQDOMM,"I recently purchased the EcoFlow Delta 2 on a shockingly good deal I saw on Amazon and I must say, it's nothing short of a game-changer! This portable power station has completely redefined the way I approach outdoor adventures, emergencies, and even daily power needs.One of the standout features of the EcoFlow Delta 2 is its seamless compatibility with portable solar panels. That being said, I would have appreciated the inclusion of the standard MC4 connector adapter; had to purchase it separately. This gave me the ability to harness the power of the sun to charge the Delta while off the grid. The flexibility to charge using solar energy not only saves me money in the long run but also empowers me to go on extended trips without worrying about running out of power.Speaking of power, the EcoFlow Delta 2 truly lives up to its name. With an impressive capacity, it effortlessly handles charging a multitude of devices simultaneously. From smartphones and laptops to power tools and even mini-fridges, the Delta 2's array of output options ensures that no matter what the situation, I'm always connected and powered up. The fact that it maintains a stable and reliable power output is particularly reassuring, especially during crucial moments or in unexpected power outages.The user-friendly app and controls make operating the Delta 2 a breeze. The large, bright LCD screen provides real-time data on input and output wattage, battery level, and more. This keeps me informed about the system's status, ensuring I can make the most of the available energy.Despite its robust power capabilities, it's surprisingly portable - lightweight and easy to transport thanks to the built-in handle.All in all, the EcoFlow Delta 2 has exceeded my expectations",5.0,2023-08-22,United Kingdom 
R3D3Y6U21IBMJ8,"I live in an area where we get quite a lot of electric outages and having got caught out with a 10 day lack of powe,r 18 months ago I decided to build up a system to help out.  I am a small octogenarian lady with mobility problems, so ease of use is exceptionally important to me.  I started off with a River Max 2  and was very pleased with it, but needed a lot more power, so decided to try the Delta 2.I have tried out all my important appliances with the Eco flow power stations and have found everything to be compatible.  The Delta 2, weighing about 12lbs is the heaviest that I can cope with, but will actually keep my gas boiler going, which is very important.  I only had to change the boiler from  a hard -wired switch to a 3 pin plug, so can now plug the boiler into the Delta 2, as needed.  It recharges very quickly from a mains supply, but  I am still struggling with my solar panels. That is a different story! I have actually invested in 4 Delta 2's and 2 River 2 Max's, which should see me through a longish power outage.  The only thing I don't like is that I purchased an extra battery for the Delta 2 and was not aware that the battery can only be charged in conjunction with the main unit.  That means moving 2 heavyish items to recharge, if using the solar panels, rather than just 1 at a time.I can certainly recommend this product.",5.0,2023-10-04,United Kingdom 
R2QL1TLG9A577Y,"So this is the second machine I have purchased (the other one I bought was the River 2 pro, when I say these are gateway machines I mean it as you'll just want to buy more)I am pleasantly surprised at how much this bad boy can do, I use this as part of a system, so this works great at charging all my bigger items, have even used it on my washing machine, tv, and PlayStation.Granted for me, I had debated whether or not to get this one or the bigger version, and speaking with others on the matter as much as we love this machine, we feel like the bigger model is needed if say for instance if you use the power stream and want to catch all those lovely rays (for me not so much of an issue seeing as I have the river 2 pro as well)Honestly, I can't find any issues in regards to this machine and I've had it a while now and still going strong. Have found Ecoflow to be very helpful in general when I had some queries about a different product.Yes, it is an investment in a way but I feel like you have to spend money to save money, especially with the cost of everything and Electric right now. I did deep-dive research before I made the leap but I'm glad that I did and I'd say trust me, these machines are worth it as currently with my set up, it's roughly about 80p a day saved with my electricity yearly it really adds up (these are my own figures so would be different for others)",5.0,2023-08-22,United Kingdom

R13J0NZUWH926R,"The power station arrived well packaged. Up and connected to the WiFi and app within minutes. Immediately had a firmware update which is positive as it implies EcoFlow support and update their products. Topped up charge using the supplied AC lead, when charging ataximum speed the fans sprung into action, however these were not excessively loud, the fans stop when the charging speed is reduced. The power station was bought mainly to power our camping adventures. I tried powering our F45 Alpicool fridge and it powered this for 24 hours using less than 25% of the battery so should last well over a weekend. I tried using it for higher loads powering a toaster then a kettle. I did this twice using only 6% battery which I would then topped up quickly using a portable 200w solar panel so great able to use free power. I think using in conjunction with our solar panel will allow us full off grid when camping, for days when the sun isn't shining being able to top up quickly via AC or while driving is great. I would also like to use this with with EcoFlow Ppwerstream micro inverter with a couple of 400w panels will be able to cover my background AC usage at home with the Delta 2 toping up when the sun isn't shining and then being charged when the sun is, I estimate this will take about 50% of my home electricity bill.

R2WNRZIH1YUVV,"We bought the Eco-flow Delta 2 power bank for our new camper van after much discussion about all the other power banks out there we felt this was the best and most suitable for our needs. I use a mobility scooter when out and about so if we want off grid ie, no electric on site I needed something that was powerful and versatile to charge the scooter battery. I can do this with the delta 2 as you can do 240v charging/3 pin plug. We also bought the solar panels (see my other review) so who can complain about green, environmentally friendly and free solar energy. It’s allowed me to be out and about with the van and know I can recharge my battery when needed.I also wanted to be able to use my GHD hairdryer/straighteners, air fryer toaster etc and you just can’t beat the Delta 2 for this. The only niggle is the noise that comes from the power bank when in use which comes from the fans, we know it can’t be helped but it can be managed by time ie when you charge items. It would be nice to have a wireless charging place on top and covers over the different ports to prevent dust etc getting inside them, but you can’t have everything. Despite all that which is my personal would likes, this is an amazing piece of kit and would highly recommend buying it, you won’t be disappointed.",5.0,2023-08-23,United Kingdom 
RNDFF6X1HTUQ1,"UPDATE:Following further advances in the firmware it now allows you to set the on and off time so you can effectively set it to charge in cheap rate, this is a huge + to the product, this coupled with a few other enhancements in the firmware and some good dealings with customer service about the max battery charging problems i've uprated this to 4 stars.We bought this and the extender battery to bring the capacity of energy close to 2kWh and the max boost of around 1.8kW. First off, it does this, the units are well built, well packaged and well presented, the display is clear and it's obvious what is going on. The display while clear seems to have a problem when you first remove the protector, the screen distorts and is unreadable, after a short period of minutes this does revert back to readable again, bit of a shock on first peeling that off and thinking its broken though.The power delivery has a significant loss vs what it draws - if you have it plugged to mains and using a load you can see there is a loss in the inversion / pass through of the power in the system, example: 500w load will see 550w pulling from the grid, a loss of about 10% for the battery to be in the loop. This wouldn't be so bad if it was pulling from the battery and inverting the supply, but it's not, this is where the units functionality starts to fall short.The peak load can actually deliver up over 2kW which is really impressive and over its rated max, however it will trip out occasionally on this load (understandable), the problem with this behaviour is that it doesn't let you know, so you have to guess at what happened, and sure enough, turn on ac delivery again and the plugged in device picks up where it left off. This leads me onto the software...Would I buy it again? maybe, the advances in the firmware have made it so much more servicable and useful than before, it is still expensive.",4.0,2022-11-08,United Kingdom 
R3044Y70KPUZRP,"I mainly got this for home emergency power to keep things running during power cuts.I was going to semi wire it in so it would always be ready for action keeping the heating etc working..However, the unit uses over 15 watts of power when plugged into the AC mains and with the AC output on (with nothing plugged in and the batteries 100% charged) it uses between 16 and 17 Watts.Thus it would put another £50.00 on my annual electric bill (dec 2022 prices).I would have expected this value for an ""ECO"" product to being under 2 watts when not charging and in bypass mode.Other than that it all works well.The firmware update from the app I found confusing as the version number seems to go down rather than up but later it is clearer as it updates the WiFi and main unit and thus two things are updated.The timer options under Lab Features, Automations look useful and it should be possible to charge on off peak and use the inverter during the day (I suspect a smart AC plug / time switch would be needed to disconnect the unit from AC mains during the day so the battery is used for the load.I also like in the app that you can set the unit to charge to a lower capacity than 100% which should make the battery last a lot more charge cycles.One last note, you can't actually turn it off when it is plugged into the mains, something the instruction manual fails to tell you.",4.0,2022-12-11,United Kingdom

It will power the Moho as a single entity replacing Electrical Hook Up (EHU) if you want or you can power individual items including microwaves and coffee machines.Recharging it is easy, we have a 220 Ecoflow solar panel that can be put out for charging swiftly in sunlight, or charge via your normal 12v cigarette lighter socket when on the move.  If on an EHU it’s very quick to recharge and you can set the input level so as not to trip the site electrics if need be.We have just used it for a month away in Spain and Portugal and spent half our nights off grid in beautiful locations with the capacity to live as if on a site with full EHU.  It can also power the fridge but probably for 6 hours max whilst receiving a good solar recharge from the panel at the same time.

We now use the power to charge all of our iPads, phones, little lanterns etc and it’s giving us a noticeable saving each day on the electricity we use which is great. We use it for the hoover, lawn mower, and other household appliances thanks to the high output on the Delta 2.I’ve just been away for the weekend and took the Delta 2 with us and sitting outside at night we had all our devices running off it and if we went out during the day it came with us and we were never without power.

R1FKTMBIF6F06D,"We wanted a leisure battery setup for our camper van/camping. The hope was to go fully electric (no gas, even for cooking). After research I found this product, specification wise it ticked all the boxes. We can run a kettle, induction hob, charge phones/ipads, lights, etc. from it, and it has done this faultlessly so far.It is a big outlay money wise. However, if you price up all the separates you'd need to recreate a leisure battery setup in your van comparable to what this unit offers (i.e. batteries, DC-DC battery charger, MPPT, 1800w continuous inverter), you'd be spending twice the money. Additionally, all of that kit would be fixed into your van, whereas this unit is easily portable.Not only do we now not have to buy gas bottle refills, but we also save money by not having an electric hook-up at any camp site we stay at.

The two units stack securely on top of each other and fit between the driver and passenger seats, out of the way. Charging through the 12v plug is ideal over a 2 or 3 hour drive. Though the plug gets quite hot, it hasn't blown any fuses as yet. But something to watch.Charging on solar is a bit rubbish this time of year, unless you have a massive array.Charging through mains is super fast, but if you don't need it quick, its best to adjust the charge input through the app. I usually charge at around 800w, to save the battery life.I'm hoping it will save me a bit of cash by charging overnight on economy 7 and using it through the day to boil the kettle, run the vacuum etc.I think with the threatened power cuts, it should prove invaluable at home.

R3CCPPB4EB5YNI,"I bought this after buying the smaller capacity River Max 2, which didn't power as many devices as I'd have liked, the Delta 2 however has worked with everything I've plugged into it Microwave, Air fryer, a treadmill, at full capacity it powers a 65 inch tv and a PlayStation 5 for 3.5- 4 hours.The interface and app tell you how much power the devices you have plugged in are using and how long it will power them for & it's been quite interesting seeing how much power some of the devices I thought were supposed to be energy saving were actually usingThe biggest selling point for me was the 5 year warranty, with the current price of electricity it'd take you 3-4 years to make your money back so anything over this is a bonus, I'm currently saving up for the additional batteries and a higher capacity solar panel to test the solar charging speed, I'm happy with it so far but would need to see how many years it continues to work for to be fully content.",5.0,2023-08-21,United Kingdom 
R2M8E0XQZBUKIA,"The EcoFlow DELTA 2 Portable Power Station is a really useful hedge in times of power uncertainty. It can power a wide range of devices, from small electronics like laptops and smartphones to larger appliances like refrigerators and microwaves.It charges very very quickly from a wall socket. I tried it with solar input and whilst understandably slower that a grid supplied source it was able to charge the unit completely on a sunny day.I read the reviews where the device discharged completely over a short period of time, I charged the Delta 2 2 months ago and turned it on this morning to find it still showing 99%. Perhaps the person that wrote the review forgot to turn their unit off or perhaps they received a faulty unit.Overall, the EcoFlow DELTA 2 Portable Power Station is a great choice for anyone looking for the piece of mind that comes with having a backup power source.

I was originally looking at the River 2 but decided to be really useful whilst camping off grid it would be better to have a higher wattage output at 230v  so went for the Delta 2. I connected a standard cigar lighter socket to my mppt output and  used the supplied cable to connect to the Delta 2 12volt input socket.  I can fully charge the Delta 2 using this method without reverting to AC charging.  The app functions well allowing you to control the charge rate from the solar output. Overall it has been performing very well at home using it to charge phones etc.  We trialled using a 230 volt hairdryer for when we are off grid and it worked perfectly, obviously will be useful to run other 230 v appliances.I am very pleased with it, build quality is excellent and it performs just expected.",5.0,2023-08-29,United Kingdom

Came across EcoFlow and the Delta 2 and seemed too good to be true by way of what I wanted. I watched various comparison videos on YouTube and review websites and the Delta 2 came out on top every time.For me I wanted a future proof device that for everyday use will function as an effective and reliable UPS. We live in an area with frequent powercuts that after a storm can last for up to 12hrs. Working from home, IOT devices, CCTV all depend on power and internet connectivity. The Delta 2 handles this with complete ease. The day after it was delivered we had a very short power cut…it switched over in milliseconds and I didn’t lose connectivity at all.

RO0W3WHUZ4JDJ,"I bought this at a £200 discount during Amazon Prime Day. Compared to other choices it is light at around 11kg and the killer for me is that it has LFP (LiFePO4) batteries rather than Li-on. You don't need to know the battery chemistry, just that this is good for 3000 cycles compared to maybe 800 for Lion.It was easy to plug in and charge and the instructions to set up an Ecoflow online account and the iphone app were straightforward and it paired first time with no problems. There are plenty of options in the app setting menu; for example a Tesla-like slider if you want to charge it to less than 100% and clear information about input and output wattage.I have used it on a low wattage fridge for a day and a half without problems and, just to see what would happen, with my 240v AC car charger.

A recent job for a local charity in the middle of a field using a circular saw was made so much easier using the EcoFlow rather than moving all the wood to a power supply. After cutting approx 30 scaffold boards it was still showing 80% charge. It recharges pretty quickly too and my husband has found it intuitive to operate. We’ve found charging it from the motorhome solar easy and you can control the charge rate from the app to make sure the onboard leisure batteries are maintained.

This extra battery plus the delta 2 are double that.This setup easily powers kitchen kettle, wife's hair dryer and the fridge freezer plus diesel heater in our campervan with ease.I haven't tested recharging by solar panels yet as its currently winter but it recharges well by 12volt and no problem with our little petrol generator.All things considered I would have no hesitation in recommending this to others as it has a 5 year warranty and life of 10 years which I believe represents value for money.",5.0,2023-12-27,United Kingdom

R2F2BYATXCDYLB,"As there are a lot of these power supplies available, I took some time to check my requirements and the features available. I chose the EcoFlow Delta 2 because it has the capacity to run most of the equipment in my home (not all at once) as well as portable tools away from a power source. The continuous output easily runs a small microwave and in x-boost mode will boil a 3kw kettle. The capacity of 1kWh gives a generous running time before needing a recharge. I also liked the fact it uses LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries which not only have more charge cycles available but are safer. My only small complaints are the fans are rather noisy when at a high discharge or charge rate, and the switches on the back to turn the AC and DC outputs on are rather small to find. This is probably more noticable on the UK models as our mains plugs are larger than abroad. Overall I am very impressed with the EcoFlow Delta 2.",5.0,2022-12-09,United Kingdom

R1PPEUY3V90LPZ,I bought the EcoFlow mainly to use in our camper van and to take to our caravan storage facility so we can plug  a jet washer and hoover in.

Vacuumed the car with a Dyson, let the family use their hairdryers with it in the morning and 20 mins of circular saw use only at 15% and that is pretty heavy load stuff.

R1SRN9UD9AX7W5,"This review is for a 240W USB-C to USB-C charge cable, branded Anker - a big name in USB chargers, cables and power banks.  It is presented in an attractive box which makes it ideal to give as a gift, but does seem to be slightly excessive packaging.Construction is excellent, with a durable braided card, aluminium shrouds at each end, and decent strain relief. It feels quality, and feels like it will last.  A rubber strap is included.Charging specs are impressive, claiming 240W.  I don't have anything that demanding, but did measure 95W charging a DJI Drone and 85W charging my Mac.Data speeds are less impressive, and appear to be USB2 only speeds.The charge rating is stamped on one of the shrouds, which is to be applauded, although I would have preferred to see it on both, along with the USB spec, ie USB2 in this case.Currently, it's just under £20, and for that I would have expected to see a fast USB3/4 cable.",4.0,2024-08-11,United Kingdom
R3PVO2B11F7PPF,This Anker cable is advertised as a 240W fast charging cable not a data cable so the fact it only supports 480Mbps (USB 2) data transfer rates is relatively irrelevant. It is still perfectly adequate for the odd bit of data transferring however if you specifically require a data cable then this isn’t for you. This cable is a little on the expensive side at £23 and as such a faster data cable - USB 3 or 4 - which also supports PD 240W is not much more expensive so you may decide that is a better option.The cable itself as you would expect from a brand like Anker is great quality and apparently made from more recycled materials which can only be a good thing.,4.0,2024-08-13,United Kingdom
R3MA66NRUV5DO6,"This single USB-C to USB-C fast charging cable by Anker arrived in a branded cardboard box neatly coiled up with an in-built rubber strap to keep the cable tidily together. I ordered this cable to charge my laptop (although bear in mind you need a suitable USB-C PD ported plug to fast charge with). The cable I ordered is 6ft in length which is a good length for my laptop, but it also comes in a 3ft length which may be more suitable for phones and tablets.I am using the cable with a GaN charger and I’m really pleased with its performance so far. The cable offers 240W charging meaning that it has the ability to power higher draw devices such up laptops as well as power banks, phones and tablets. It can also transfer data at up to 480Mbps, but bear in mind that this is quite slow by modern standards (USB 2.0 speed) and it is also worth noting that the cable does not support screen mirroring.The cable has a good flexibility with a grey / black, woven nylon braided finish made from recycled materials and it doesn’t tangle easily nor fray. The finish feels premium / durable and there is strain relief at the connection points. The cable has been tested to withstand 300000+ bends so I feel like I can have confidence in this product and it is pretty future proof in terms of charging capabilities.The fit of the connections into the ports is good without being too tight or loose and the connections appear to be good quality with the USB-C ends not having any seams (a good sign of a quality cable). Priced at £19.49 at the time of reviewing, I would say this is a good price for the excellent build quality of this cable particularly since it comes with a 2-year warranty included. I feel like if you look after the cable, it should last a good amount of time so I would be happy to recommend it.",5.0,2024-09-13,United Kingdom

The eco-friendly materials used in its construction are a nice touch, reflecting Anker's commitment to sustainability without compromising on quality. The cable feels robust and well-made, giving you confidence that it will withstand daily wear and tear.One of the standout features of this cable is its e-marking with the Anker brand, which sets it apart from cheaper alternatives that lack a chip.

Whether you're charging a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, this cable performs exceptionally well, delivering fast and efficient power transfer.

This cable is really exceptionally good quality, with a thick braided cable and very sturdy metal and plastic fittings at either end. It comes ready with a cable tie attached so you can always easily roll it up to carry or store.Charging is genuinely fast (assuming you have a device that supports fast charging), and this despite the length of the cable. That length is so useful - especially for me, living in an older house in which the sockets are never quite where you would like them.I can't fault this cable. It is quite heavy, not necessarily ideal for shoving in a pocket or small bag; but its robustness would make it a great travel option if you have a suitcase to throw it in between stops. Five stars very easily for this item.",5.0,2024-09-11,United Kingdom
R1WA4DX7ZNWR2F,"I don't think this is a Data/Thunderbolt cable, nonetheless for the devices which support as much as 240W charging such as the newer MacBook Pros, some high end gaming laptops etc. Where portability and fast charging is required, this does the job.Of course you'd not want to keep this permanently charging for continuous AC use, though once reaching 100% this would trickle charge. So although the cable boasts the technology and durability to do so, I see this as more of an emergency charger for those on the go.As for regular indoo rcharging, most people are aware that rapid charging will typically reduce your batteries life and duration.So I'd use a default wattage charger typically, but it's useful to have one of these around when you cannot wait, and you need a full charge ASAP. Especially if it's a work laptop that you dont have to maintain.In typical Anker style, it comes in a lovely decorated and premium box, with great presentation. The nylon braided cable itself has the highest ot durability and stress testing standards, and the typical overheating, overcurrent and other circuitry protection. It also comes with a nice black rubber cable tie thats attached for easy and tidy storage. Of course there isn't any reason why this cannot charge other 65W, 100W devices, tablets or Smart Phones being backwards compatible charging them at their maximum rate with leftover, it could also be a power supply to various docking stations providing you have the plug, and not Thunderbolt bidirectional data transfer charging cables.But countless devices, docking stations and other computer related equipment require their own dedicated type C power input. I can't think of too many particular laptop models that require as much power as 240W but there are plenty of very high end modern Laptops that do, plus all of the mot modern and high end tablets no problem if it's power supply only.Perhaps a Thunderbolt 4 240W cable would have been versatile being able to do the same and more, but since I don't see any Thunderbolt 4 support, plus I think they would be significantly more expensive.For the very high quality, I think this 2M cable is appropriately priced at around £22. So i'll not be deducting any stars, i'd have liked perhaps some different colour braided options and styling on the casing maybe, but that's being fussy and quite subjective anyway. For the purpose they're intended I would recommend this product, from a highly reputable brand.",5.0,2024-08-11,United Kingdom

However, Anker has taken the inexplicable decision to limit the data throughput to a pathetic 480 Mbps – that's USB 2 speed. Why, Anker?

It is thicker than its more delicate brethren, a necessary sacrifice for the conveyance of such potent energy. This added bulk comes at a cost to flexibility, but it is a trade I am willing to make.The strain relief at its extremities is a welcome feature. Countless cables have met their demise at this vulnerable juncture. The Anker, however, shows no signs of weakness there. It feeds my Chromebook with vigor, a testament to its capacity. While I have yet to harness its full potential, as my charging equipment is of a more modest nature, it handles the current load with aplomb.It is a tool, pure and simple, designed for a specific purpose.

At least this cable will hopefully future-proof itself should power requirements of tomorrows kit have a wattage boost.£23 for this cable (at the time of my order) is a little steep in my opinion, given that there’s similar cables out there that will do the same thing for half the price.

R21EOZJP3OD7SU,I can never seem to have enough USB cables these days and where possible always try to buy Anker products as I find them really well made and reliable.I ordered the 6 foot cable and it's really well made and comes in a nice box. The braiding on the cable is nicely done and it feels like it will last a long time. I've not got anything over 100w but the cable has worked perfectly with everything I've used it with.,5.0,2024-08-13,United Kingdom
R3KT571EHVOSZK,"This is a good quality USB cable, with a nice braid and it comes with a little rubber strap to help coil it up.It supports 240 watt charging which is great, that's the top spec for USB at the moment.The data rate though is at USB 2.0 levels so it's basically useless for anything but charging. That's 480 Mbps as opposed to the top USB 3.2 spec of 40 Gbps.Given that this is one of the most expensive USB cables I've seen recently, I don't know why they'd bother making it at all. It makes sense to offer higher power, low data rate cables that are cheaper than their high power high data rate cousins. It does not make sense to offer cables that are more expensive than most that meet the highest USB 4 specification, yet offer no advantages.It's no wonder they've only printed the power rating on this cables connectors, and not the data rating. My policy is that I deduct a star if both aren't printed. The overwhelming majority of cables I've had in the last year have both printed on them, it's not hard at all, and it's crucial so that we can easily identify the appropriate cable in our tech pouch. We don't want our charging or our data transfer rate limited by the simple fact that we used the wrong cable because there's no way to memorise all your cables if you're a normal human being. Not only should this cable not exist at this price and lack of functionality, it isn't even properly labelled.Anker can do a lot better as a brand, I've had plenty of products from them that were fairly priced, and properly made to modern standards. All you can say that's positive about this cable it's it's physically well constructed and can supply a lot of power. Which is not enough to justify it existing at all, let alone the price. I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.*I will also add that this came in a box, which is all cardboard but still, is an absolute waste of packaging. It's made to be hung up in a shop. Fair enough, maybe do that version. But why not ship it without to people buying online? It's just manufactured waste that has to be recycled.*Also, I am genuinely angry, I was just being humorous. This sort of stuff really frustrates me because they can do better and there's zero reason not to.",2.0,2024-08-12,United Kingdom
R3139ZRDXD5J3T,"In terms of quality, this cable feels really nice. The braided design is flexible and feels great to the touch, but the most important aspect is that it's a high-powered cable, rated at 240 watts. My Motorola phone confirms that it’s charging in rapid mode, and that’s all that matters to me. I hope it lives up to my expectations in terms of jhow long it is going to last—if not, I’ll update my review accordingly.",5.0,2024-08-10,United Kingdom
RBSNTSX0U152G,This is a premium quality cable.

R35HCNG4URNTS5,"This Anker Prime Cable is an excellent choice if you need a reliable, high-speed charging solution. It’s built to last, performs exceptionally well, and the eco-friendly materials are a nice touch. Unlike other cables, it has a nice weight to it so it not only performs as a premium product but also feels like one.The upcycled-braided nylon feels incredibly sturdy, yet flexible. It’s obvious that this cable is designed to last. The material doesn’t tangle easily, and it seems like it will hold up well even with heavy use.My laptop has a maximum charging speed of 100w, so this cable is more than capable of delivering that and will be future proof should I purchase devices which need upto 240w of power.Cable is e-Marked with Anker as the vendor and supports 50V / 5A / 240W EPR. Cable data transfer speed is USB 2.0. The packaging is sleek and well-designed, giving a nice first impression and would make an ideal gift!Bought primarily to use as a laptop charging cable.

It works wonderfully to create sleek, smooth, and soft hair with an impressive shine, just like you’d get from a professional salon.I purchased this after retiring my old straightener, which lasted over 10 years, and  upgrading to GHD is a game changer!

R2LW512ZU819ED,Comparing these ghd to the divabrand of straighteners.  These ghd ones are very basic straighteners in comparison to the diva ones i had.  With the diva ones I had i could set the temperature to what I wanted and it also had a clip at the end to close them when not in use.  The hot plate although adequate on these ghds and does the job I intended to use them for and are good at curling.  The hot plates are shorter in length in comparison to the diva ones I had which means I can't put as much hair in and that means It takes me longer to do my hair cos my hair is thick.  they do look sturdy and dont feel heavy to hold while doing my hair but Over all i think i would have bought the diva ones again if I had to chose again.,5.0,2024-11-25,United Kingdom

Sadly it seems that the quality has greatly decreased in that time. The straightener's feel quite flimsy in comparison to their predecessor. As someone with quite fine hair I was disappointed that on first use the plates do not seem to meet fully and it seemed to take more effort to get the straightening that I have been used to. Honestly probably wouldn't recommend these, which is sad as GHD seem to be operating on a previously gained great reputation while now not offering the same quality product.",3.0,2024-11-26,United Kingdom

I tend to go for the top range of things in general, but considering the price difference I didn’t and I’m really pleased I got this one.

RV8N98YLWQTXJ,"I wanted an open ear design as I find having something stuck in my ears whilst exercising becomes uncomfortable. Naturally I was drawn to the Bose Open Ultra clip-on earbud, but I could not justify the £250 to £299 cost for running on the treadmill or around the park.  And let’s be honest do we really need an audiophile quality sound when sweating and dodging others whilst out running?As a brand I love Anker and have a number of their power solutions - they justifiably have a great reputation in this area, but I was still somewhat dubious about a pair of £45 clip on open earbuds.  I thought they would be tinning and disappointing.  Having worn my newly acquired ones over the last few days I can report that I find them pretty comfortable and have a pretty impressive sound quality.  Even when load enough to hear them over the TV (when my wife is watching) they do not leak significant sound.  The standard EQ is OK, but I still downloaded the app onto my iPhone and tried the other options.  To me the Bass present sounds awful (flat), I agree with other reviewers who say the spacial audio/surround is rather disappointing and that was true for the vast majority of music from most of my streaming sources I use.  There are some tracks that do sound pretty ok.  But again, this is not really the purpose of these buds (I am also in love with my Sonos Era 300, so these are never going to stand up to muster).  That said if you spend even a few moments with the custom options and set an EQ profile that suits your taste you will find these little bits of clip on plastic more than capable of sounding nice whilst exercising.Reviewer also mention that they are poor for call quality - again not really surprising when you consider the design and their intended purpose.Would I recommend these? If you have no financial limits and you want to sit in quiet environments, I would hazard the Bose are better, but for exercising with I can't imagine they are 5 times the price better.Anker/Soundcore have done it again. They have built a good (not super premium) quality product and brought it to market at a price that delivers pragmatically pleasing results at a sensible price - thanks Anker.A last point - the case is a little naff, serviceable and functional but does let the overall package down.  I do not need or even really want wireless charging, but the case does feel like it is - plastic.",5.0,2024-09-03,United Kingdom
R3G6NNYCWZK8XR,"I so wanted to love these earbuds for the following reasons1.  They sound great for non-invasive earbuds.  Lovely rich sound.2.  They look cool!  I got them in the pearl colour and they look great in the ears.3.  Great price for quality of them.However, for me, only one ear was comfortable.  The left ear - no problem... no pressure and so very comfy.  The right ear - oooof....it squeezed right from the start and the pressure and pain got worse the longer I wore them.I guess I have odd ears.  I also guess, these will fit some, and not others.I hope they fit you, for the 3 reasons above.",4.0,2024-11-14,United Kingdom

R21PTFZGNFZET1,"I’ve always had a positive experience with Anker products, but these open-ear buds didn’t fully live up to my expectations. Here’s my detailed breakdown:Pros: • Build Quality: Solid construction, as you’d expect from Anker. The product feels durable and well-made, appropriate for its price range. • Connectivity: Stable connection without drops during use. However, the range isn’t as strong as some competitors like AirPods – once you have a few walls between you, they lose connection. • Charging Speed: The charging time was quick, which is a plus if you’re always on the go.Cons: • Fit: Unfortunately, the fit wasn’t as comfortable as I hoped. After about an hour of wear, my ears started to hurt, and even after taking them off, the discomfort lingered. • Sound Quality: The sound quality was disappointing. It felt finicky, requiring the perfect angle to hit the ear canal, and didn’t compare well to other open-ear devices like Meta glasses. • Functionality: The haptic button behind the ear was awkward to use and often didn’t respond properly. I would have preferred a tap-anywhere function like the first-gen AirPods. • Volume and Conversations: When the volume is high, it’s difficult to have a conversation without taking them off or pausing the music entirely.Value for Money:While these buds are built well and have fast charging, the poor sound quality and uncomfortable fit make it hard to justify the price. With a few improvements, they could be a good value, but in their current state, they fall short.",3.0,2024-10-13,United Kingdom

R2HO9MFV55ZJIZ,"The sound from the earbuds was good, as I have always found with Anker products however I found them difficult to fit and painful when worn for just a short period of time.  I tried to ease them off slightly by heating them gently and bending them (as you would with the legs of eye glasses) this improved the fit but neither earbud would charge following this procedure.I take the blame for this and the only reason for mentioning it in the review is to advise others not to try the same thing.As for the fit of the headphones they are not for me but others may find them fine.I have since purchased Anker Soundcore V20i open earbuds which I find to be a very comfortable alternative.",3.0,2025-03-21,United Kingdom
R1LRFTOKKSS2KK,"I've been looking for some open earbuds for a while now as I wanted something for listening to podcasts while both working and walking outside.I didn't really want to pay the £300 for a pair of Bose (I have both Bose Quiet Comfort buds and 700 Headphones and I honestly don't think they are worth the money) and as I already have many sets of SoundCore earbuds and headphones I thought I would give these a try.Firstly, the sound quality is great for listening to Podcasts, Audio Books etc. I While they also sound good for certain types of music, for others not so much (for example Rock doesn't sound good).When using them for calls/online meetings I have found them very good.  Being open, you can hear your environment (and yourself) so you don't end up talking too loudly or quietly.  The sound quality from the microphones is very clear.Battery life is great, you certainly get several hours from a charge, I don't know how long the total battery life is yet as I haven't needed to charge the case yet.I find the touch controls a little fiddly.  They are at the rear of the buds, so you have to hook your finger around the back of the bud to use the limited controls (basically just tap once, twice or hold).Finally the biggest issue for me is the fit and comfort.  I guess this will be different for everyone, but for me they become uncomfortable after around 30 minutes of wear time.  They seem to just push into my ear cartilage a little too  hard, so after a while they just hurt. I've tried wearing them at different points on my ear and they just aren't comfortable for long term wearing.  I do find if I wear them a little higher up my ear they are better, but then this has a negative impact on the sound quality.If these were more comfortable to wear then they would be nearly perfect, but they are not quite there for me.",4.0,2024-09-09,United Kingdom
R1Y8XDKL3USPRV,"I bought these a while ago after being advised not to wear in-ear earbuds anymore. At first, I was a little sceptical about how well they would work given that they clip onto the ear, which seemed like poor placement. However, having tried them for a few months now, I've actually been impressed at both the quality and loudness of the sound without too much noise-leakage. They don't provide any kind of noise cancelling, so they aren't perfect for listening to podcasts and audiobooks on busy roads or in very crowded areas, but they've been perfect for casual music listening.The only real issues I've had with them are around the design.First, they do have some touch features on the back of each ear bud, which are great - play/pause by tapping, skipping forwards/backwards with double taps, and volume up and down when holding a finger to the touch sensor. The only issue I've really had with these is the earbud registering touches on my neck when moving my head around and pausing my music, but these features can be turned off so it's not a massive issue.Second, due to the rigid nature of the design, they have started to hurt my ears when wearing for prolonged periods of time. For shorter periods, they've been great, but the lack of flexible bridge between the sound driver in the ear and the touch pad behind the ear leads to a bit more clamping than is entirely comfortable.",3.0,2024-12-29,United Kingdom

R2TD9Y8XC7T6T6,"I also have the Bose ultra open and the Huawei freeclips, which also fit onto the antihelix part of the ear.Firstly, the soundcore sound decent for the money and have the largest diaphragm, however they are the quietest and have the least dynamic range. They do, however have very good openness, probably on a par with the Huawei, but bigger and deeper than the Bose.The main issue for me is comfort. The soundcore come with some hard plastic clips to make the gap smaller. This doesn't work as the buds are completely hard plastic and the buds always feel like they are pinching, they also gradually slide down the ear until they have to be adjusted. They are by far the most uncomfortable of the 3 and the most uncomfortable earphones I have tried. The touch controls work ok, but can be temperamental and need to be touched in exactly the right place.The Huawei is vastly more comfortable, but does move around on the ear slightly more, the sound however is as wide, but with vastly better imaging and range. They are also the loudest of all 3. The Huawei also works the best in terms of touch controls and feels the best made by a longway. They also switch ears automatically if you swap them, so no dedicated left and right, they also have tap control instead of touch so simply touching them won't change tracks, they need a tap, this works so well I can change tracks/pause etc by tapping my face Infront of the earphones (volume control is turned on in the app and is off by default, but works by tapping and holding) and they have the best mic as they use bone conducting. The Bose and soundcore don't come close the the mic quality.The Bose is the most comfortable, but does sit lower (The buds can be positioned anywhere on the antihelix, but for me between the antihelix and earlobe feels great and sounds the best in terms of hifi sound. The Bose are the warmest sound but are also quite narrow sounding when compared to the other 2. They are however wider sounding than the Bose QC ultra. In fact, the over all sound is better than the QC ultras and is closer to my B&O EX earbuds but lacking the bdeep bass, the Bose do have bass but it's not as forward and they are miles behind the B&O H95 though, but those are headphones. The touch controls are simple buttons, but they control everything, including volume and work flawlessly.All 3 of these open earbuds though, sound vastly better than the shokz open run, or open run pros (I only have the pros now, which are better than the non pro version. However, I truly hate them as they give me massive pain where they sit just Infront of the ear and they sound horrendous.",2.0,2024-12-24,United Kingdom

I’m even able to wear them while working and not ignore my coworkers.It feels like the battery last forever, and they charge really quickly. For someone who’s always worn overear headphones because I couldn’t get a good fit out of anything else, these fit great and with the added bonus of grips, you’ll find what suits you.The reason for knocking two stars off is because of the touch controls.

RQOHETSZDBFWF,"Bought these because I have a new daith piercing and, being that they don’t sit inside the ear, they wouldn’t irritate or cause the discomfort that my regular in-ear ear buds now would/do. In terms of comfort these fit my right ear more comfortably (a bit ‘pinchy’) than my left but that might be more due to my ears rather than the buds themselves.The problem, however, was that having had these a couple of weeks, both sides have only worked simultaneously once, despite resetting them and re-pairing them a number of times. Usually only one or other side works and having contacted soundcore, it appears that they are indeed faulty out of the box. I’ll order these again (even though they are more expensive than they were on Black Friday and there is no way to just exchange them) in the hope that this was just a one-off as I have usually had a good experience with anker and soundcore before and my old ones still sound amazing years later (if only I could wear them now!).

Yes it's an odd feeling and yes you might find after a while they become uncomfortable, but they are more comfortable than other alternatives I've used.

I don't think I'd want to wear these ear buds next to new piercings because they rest slightly on the daith ring and they need careful positioning to keep them clear of the flat back of the tragus.

R2932KSRPI2WKX,"I bought a set of reconditioned C30i earbuds and have been very happy with them since day one.The battery life is excellent and the sound quality is clear and punchy - remember that these are an open-ear design; therefore, you will be able to hear external noise which will compromise what you're listening to, but this is by design.I have these to replace my version 1 Apple AirPods and what I miss in functionality is made up for by build quality, comfort and volume.  I'm certain that they won't fit everyone's ears, but they come with different-sized ear grips to help with this.  The build quality of the buds and battery case is solid as I would expect from Anker/Soundcore.I have yet to make the control button work reliably (hence the 4 star and not 5) but it's certainly not a deal breaker as I'm more than happy to use the controls on my phone.I want to try to dispel any fears people have with customer support from Anker/Soundcore (there's a 1-star review from someone who states that they stopped working after a week).  I have bought a lot of Anker/Soundcore products over the past 10 years and on a few occasions have had problems and on every occasion they were resolved with minimal fuss by their customer support (each item was replaced in days).Another thing to be aware of is price fluctuations with Anker/Soundcore as they very regularly reduce their prices so check before you buy using a price tracker website.",4.0,2024-12-05,United Kingdom

R1IUYL2MFJCT53,"I’ve wanted some open earbuds for a while now - for cycling and to prevent a repeat of ear infections due to impacted wax. I was just winding up to buy some Bose ones when I saw a colleague at work wearing these. Asked him if I could have a go and was genuinely shocked at how competent the sound quality is, especially at this price. They can get very loud and the (surprisingly excellent) phone app lets you customise the EQ very quickly and easily. The bass is never going to feel deep but it is surprisingly punchy and rich for an open device, and it’s perfectly good for casual listening, especially rock music. (Any more and I’d suggest it would negate the point of open ear buds).Did a call test with my wife. Could hear her loud and very clearly. She said the mics rustle a little when I move but aside from that they were fine; she had no problem hearing me. (That said I was in a quiet room, not a busy city street or building site).Contrary to others, I find the touch controls to be very easy to use: touch your index finger on the front part of the earbud (near your ear canal) to ‘anchor’ it and then use your thumb to tap the rear of the earbud (where the sensor is) it works perfectly. (The index finger helps to guide your thumb to the right place and apply some pinch pressure). I think the sensitivity is just right to prevent accidentally triggering the controls when moving the earbuds.A bonus is you can use the phone app to customise the controls, and even lock them.The phone app itself has a few additional use features (battery monitoring for each earbud AND the case!), various white/ambient noise generators for focusing on work etc.  It’s solid, fully featured and very easy to use. It does ask you to create a login account but allows you to skip this step if you don’t care about backing up your settings to the cloud.I’ve been wearing mine solidly for 6 hours now and can barely tell they’re in place, even though they’re very securely fitted (no chance of falling off). No fitting adapters needed for me.=== UPDATE ===I *have* experienced discomfort wearing these on one of my ears for a couple hours today (but the other ear was ok). Soreness has gone within minutes of taking them off. It seems like I was wearing it too low down and it was putting pressure on the bit of cartilage that protrudes just above my ear lobe. So if that’s you, try wearing it higher up your ear.To be honest, my biggest worry now is how many charge cycles the tiny earbud batteries will take before they become useless. Will I be able to buy new versions of these buds in the future if needed? I hope so!",5.0,2024-12-06,United Kingdom

R2NQI69PW14IX9,"They took a while to get used to putting onto my ears but when I got it right the audio quality was excellent. However on random days (about one in four) they would randomly stop or skip track as if they thought I was squeezing them two or three times respectively ... when my hands were nowhere near them. I put up with this for a while, and tried a firmware upgrade, but it didn't help so I returned them in the end.",1.0,2024-08-14,United Kingdom

R3FF3X5LH3QSX4,"I got this for a trip in South America and it was excellent. The design is sturdy and although it is fairly heavy it doesnt take up too much space in your bag.The variety of adapters included is great if you are visiting places that have varied outlet requirements. A big positive is the 2-prong adapter sticks far enough out to reach into outlets that have a depression in them. Other adapters I have had dont reach in far enough so it can be quite annoying. All the adapters have a nice slide to them and didnt get stuck or jammed once.It doesnt get too hot either and the 4 USB ports mean that lots can be charged at once. I managed to charge an electric shaver, 2 phones and a powerbank at the same time, perfect for when a hotel only has limited outlets available.Very good price and excellent performance, I highly recommend.",5.0,2024-05-20,United Kingdom

R3VGPA33S5MMDK,Good price and works well.  I bought it for a trip to Japan which uses USA 2-pin sockets. The only caution I have is that the unit was a loose fit in the socket.  I am not sure if that was caused by the unit or the socket.  The weight of the unit caused it to angle out slightly and I was concerned that it fell out.  But it didn't and everything was okay.

ROA7DZT69Q7QW,"This is a great product for what it is... It converts the plug shape/size to fit the electrical outlets of different countries.However, and this is IMPORTANT, it DOES NOT convert the voltage. So, if you have a device that uses only 110V AC, it will blow the fuse, or destroy the device if you plug the adapter into a 240V AC and plug the device into the adapter. To convert the voltage you will still need a voltage converter. Most people buying a ""travel adapter"" are probably looking for a ""voltage converter"" that comes with multiple plug adapters. If that's the case, this is not what you are looking for! Look at the photos to see what you'll probably need to get from a UK 240V AC socket to a USA 110V AC socket!If you have devices which can work with both 110V AC and 240V AC, then this adapter is all you need.",3.0,2024-09-14,United Kingdom

RKQ9A85YVQL97,"This box does amazing things!  With my Surface Laptop using Windows 10 it converts it into a desktop with 4 monitors all running at fairly high resolutions.  See picture of the finished set up, though the Dell docking station is the little white LED light rather tucked behind the laptop, out of sight and soon out of mind.  Monitor 0 is the one on the laptop, Monitors 1 to 3 are driven by the Dell effortlessly, the mouse moves smoothly from screen to screen.  I've not tried gaming.  It is light and you'll need to clamp the unit down if the wires are not to take over control - see pictures of installed unit.Setup of the Docking station, if you follow the instructions EXACTLY, is a breeze.  It seems that this is in fact mostly due to the excellent hardware and driver software provided by Displaylink but Dell get credit for clear instructions and a neat package.  Maybe it is time to return to Dell after 10 years or more away from them; they used to be the best once.  It could be improved if the USB 3 cable supplied, which is a very strange one that goes to a keyhole shaped port on the back of the unit, has a very stiff cable which is a problem with a light laptop.  A flexible, perhaps flat cable would be much better and, even better, one that has the USB at 90deg to the cable so that it does not need much side room would be good.  That said, the USB plugs in firmly and well and the real miracle is that it works - so much data is transmitted seamlessly.  I have now, within an hour of starting work got 4 monitors each showing different information and gigabit ethernet:0. 2736x18241. 1050x16802. 1920x12003  1080x1920Gigabit ethernet connection.Better still, on one of the monitors I have got a separate 3 way switch (not part of the Dell) so that I can connect a different PC to that monitor.  When I press the button this switch disconnects a monitor from the Dell.  The Dell/Windows 10 detects the change and I have a 3 monitor system.  Click it again and it goes back to being a 4 monitor system.  This is not quite flawless.  Every now and then, one of the monitors will not be correctly synched.  Turning the Dell on and Off once (pull out the power cable so keep it in reach) fixes this, so it is not very bad as it happens infrequently (one to work on though Dell/Displaylink/Microsoft ! ).What's not to like?  Well the Dell User Guide says that the Displaylink software will be loaded with the Drivers and will provide you with some extra functionality that resizes the image on each monitor.  Well it doesn't, at least on my Windows 10 system.  No software is evident anywhere and I really do need to resize one of my displays.  At full monitor resolution all the borders of the display are lost...moving windows then becomes very difficult.I have connected a USB mouse to the unit but it is not recognised.  I've tried various ports to no avail.  No mouse.Not all of the USB ports on the USB hub are powered.  This is strange because the transformer is a 65watt one and the unit runs only a little bit warmer than room temperature so it is not using much power.  So, it is rather annoying that you can't connect and get power on all 5 USB ports if you should need to.  It is also likely to lead to confusion about which one is good for power and some discharged devices from time to time so it is not very user friendly.Given my expectations of what Windows would do for me, this gets a 5.  Someone meaner might have made it a 4 because of the flaws above but, heck, this is an enormous improvement on past Windows kit.",5.0,2016-11-29,United Kingdom
R20JFN9XMNZR0M,"First off - unfortunately it is poorly advertised (and marketed on the box) as a 'dock', which isn't true. In the traditional sense that you don't 'dock' the laptop into it and it therefore doesn't provide power to your laptop. I knew this from the off so it didn't come as a surprise. It is purely a gadget into which you plug your devices and displays allowing you to connect to everything via a single USB cable into your laptop.That said, it works great. I was apprehensive at some of the reviews but honestly, it's flawless so far. Before I continue, my laptop: It's a Dell Ultrabook with 8GB RAM with a Corei5 CPU. I read somewhere (I'm sure it was on the Dell site) that it recommends a Core i7. That seemed a little odd to me and thankfully that isn't the case.Setup: Download the Windows 10 drivers from the DisplayLink website. The ones Dell provide on their site didn't allow connected monitors to work in Windows 10. If you do install them by mistake however, Windows 10 should show a pop-up that you need to update the drivers. Once I'd run the DisplayLink driver installer and rebooted, everything came to life. I have 2 23"" 1080p monitors connected. You need to go into display settings and use the box that lets you drag the monitor positions around. Once you have that set up, you're away.I also have a stereo amplifier plugged into the device and my audio is now much better as my laptop output jack was playing up previously.People mentioned display lag: For me there is none at all. I'm pleasantly surprised at how flawless it all is. I use a Lenovo X1 Carbon at work (expensive ultrabook) with a Lenovo device which does a similar job to this D3100 and I get lots of display lag on that.Tip: Turn off the Windows 10 screen 'snap' system. It's buried in settings under System > Multi-tasking > Snap (or search snap in the start menu). Otherwise every time you drag a window onto one of your external monitors, the window will try to snap into place at the bottom of the external screen.FY: I haven't tried the displayport connection or 4k and I'm not using the wired ethernet port so I can't comment on the performance of those. I have 2 1080p monitors connected via HDMI, a stereo amp via 3.5mm jack, a mouse and an external hard drive and all work perfectly. No screen lack or dodgy connections.I'm over the moon that I went ahead. I used to have a gaming PC connected up and sadly it's now so old and my laptop is much faster. This device has at least made my laptop a good device to use at my desk.",5.0,2016-01-27,United Kingdom
R3FNZE6CSW1B0Y,"I used this on a Windows 10 pro Dell M3800 laptop and wanted to use it with two 4K Samsung U28E590 monitors instead of the laptop display and 1 monitor. It feels like a quality product and is easy to set up (just go to Dell website and download driver before connecting).My only disappointment was that I missed the fact that it can't support two 4K monitors at the same time, only a 4K on one port and lower resolutions on the others. I had looked at several and by the time I found ""Ultra HD Triple Video"" thought it supported up to three 4K monitors. Well, it does, but not with them actually at 4K.It's true that had I downloaded the spec first or read all the questions the information was there but I think the description is misleading.As far as its specification goes, it works well, I use the USB 2 and 3 ports and the Displayport to a 4K monitor running at 3480x2161 plus an HDMI port to another 4K monitor running at 2560x1440.I gave 4 stars based on the 5 for quality and working smoothly but 3 for description.",4.0,2019-01-29,United Kingdom

It looks really nice as well, and not just a dull grey box. Pretty straight forward installation. The only thing to be aware of (and I had over looked this) is you'll need a DisplayPort to HDMI cable as well as a HDMI to HDMI cable if you want to run two monitors.

R2OYRORU9KQBZB,"The Dell Dock is a great product from Dell, but buy it only from the actual Dell UK website. I have been having an issue, which is inherit to such devices sometimes and something that warranty easily covers. However, as the seller buys the Dock from Singapore with a basic warranty, which means that according to Dell for them to cover you the system must be in the purchase location. Now my Dell Dock does not work and it cannot be replaced from warranty although such replacement was granted if I was in Singapore.  I cannot contact the seller as the time allowed since I have bought it has passed.TO THE SELLER:  Knowingly and dishonestly withholding information amounts to misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 in the UK. In this case, as warranty is clearly a big factor on such product and the fact that warranty cannot work in the UK as you purchased from Dell in Singapore should be disclosed along with the warranty limitations. This would have been key information I ought to know at the time of purchase.If you are able to assist me with obtaining the warranty and have a warehouse in Singapore, where a technician can come out review my dock and replace it, do let me know.

R37T0LI8N3IKC2,"First, some background..I have a high performance Dell 7510, Xeon processor, 64GB ram, 4k screen with M.2 SSD's it is the bomb..It also has 1x HDMI and 1x mini Display port.Despite all this, when connecting my 2 x 4k wide screen monitors directly from the laptops HDMI and Display Port I can never ever get the colours on both looking right. HDM and Display Port will give different colours and contrast, you need to have both HDMI or display port. I even got an adapter to go Display port to HDMI so they was both connected via HDMI. But this was also no good.I spent months frustrated with poor image quality, colours and ghosting on the text. (yes all my drivers was up to date)I plunged for the USB 3.0 HD Triple Video adapter. (I refuse to call it a docking station as you do not dock the laptop on it)This small piece of kit is simply amazing,Before plugging in the adapter via USB, first visit displaylink.com and download the latest driver for your OS.I then plugged in the the adapter and plugged both my monitors, 1 with HDM and one with Display Port.Oh know!... I still have crap looking screens...But Wait.. this adapter has 2 HDMI ports so why not try going directly from HDMI to HDMI..I connected both monitors via HDMI, the max output gave me 1920x1080 on one monitor and a max of 2560×1440 on another. You can only output 2560 on one monitor.This was fine for my needs, I use the higher resolution for photo editing and the other screen for emails and docs etc..What was so perfect was the fact (despite different screen resolutions) I finally had 2 perfect matching screens both showing the same colour and contrast / brightness with no ghosting what so ever!If my laptop had 2 HDMI ports then I would not have needed this so if you are in the same position or similar then do not hesitate to try this.To sum up, The HDMI ports are full HDMI, there is no midi HDMI.

R1G3P2B3HKK3YP,"The Dell Dock certainly over promises and under delivers.It is a Macbook pro issue for sure, however this should be stated before purchasing or in the description.Macbook pro users (with the silicone chips such as M1's) won't be able to duplicate their monitors if they have 2 screens. If you are using this for 1 external monitor, then don't hesitate to get it and go for it. 2 monitors however, then please keep clear.Using it with a work laptop which probably won't have a dedicated graphics card and if you have 2 decent (i.e 4K monitors) then it will struggle with the frame rate and your laptop will be forced to either compromise on the pixel resolution or the frame rate. Which then renders your nice monitor a little useless and you could have got more basic monitors.The good things about the Dell Dock is that it is well built, it feels solid.It has plenty of USB ports and the LAN attachment is great.

I use my laptop mainly as a desktop for college work, and the ability to detach from keyboard, mouse, and screen by one cable is very handy, I have routed the cables much more nicely than having them trail all over the laptop and desk. I have also had to work from home at times and attaching the docking station to my works laptop (also Dell) saves a lot of time and rerouting of all peripheral cables. I did as the instructions said (and on the advice of other reviewers) and made sure the drivers were updated before installing, and have had no issues with the docking station. It would be nice to switch the laptop on without opening the lid, and it is a little pricey, but other than that I think it is worth the time saved on taking out multiple cables constantly.EDIT 02/06/2020 - I wrote the above review back on Nov 2017.

Couldn’t be more pleased. It sits nicely at the side of my desk and doesn’t take up too much room. I might have liked it to have the option to stand up, so the space used was even less, but I can live with that. When it’s been on all day it does feel a little warm to the touch, but so far that doesn’t seem to be an issue.

R1X1V57RI23MJ,"I purchased this so I could quickly hook up my Dell XPS 15 to my monitors and peripherals without having to plug in a ton of usb cables into the laptop itself.I am powering two 25"" Dell monitors through this, and the first thing I noticed was that there is a fair bit of screen tearing going on. The response is definitely not as smooth and seamless as with native HDMI coming from the laptop, which was disappointing. Although not as frequent as the screen tearing, there is also some artifacting going on in certain applications. It gives the feel that the visual presentation is being ""emulated"" rather than a true, native output.Another gripe is that my monitors (running at 2560 x 1440) can only run at a maximum of 50hz using the dock. For me, this is not hugely important but I can still notice the difference and it is somewhat annoying, particularly when watching 60hz content, as this can judder unnaturally.Apart from this, it does a decent job at handling all the USB peripherals I plug into it, as well as audio and network, none of which I've had any problems with.

With the Dell Docking station, before connecting it you install the driver from the enclosed DVD. An error message told me to upgrade my USB3.0 Renesas drive, with a link which provided the most recent driver. Once this was done and you have connected the monitors (I used the DP and one of the two HMDI port on the dockstation), you right click on the screen and open the Nvidia control panel where you can exclude the laptop screen, make one external monitor principal and extend to the other one. From Windows Adjust screen resolution you can set the resolution to 1920x1200 et voila'. Screens work perfectly, support native resolution and I can watch videos on both at the same time.

I use this on Windows 10 in case anyone is interested.User experience is very good too, so far I haven't experienced any sort of lag or any issues for that matter.The entire base of the unit is rubberised so it should grip to most desk surfaces quite well - however due to it's light weight any trailing cables at the rear of the unit can displace it if you're not careful.

From what I understand on Linux the DisplayLink drivers recruit the CPU to aid in graphical operations which leads to MONSTROUS CPU usage from DisplayLink. On my laptop (Dell XPS13 2015) I see CPU usage regularly sitting at 70-90%. This drops to 10% if there's no action on the screen but even the movement of a cursor causes it to jump to those high ranges.This bit of kit works great and does its job well when supported by the correct software - but buyer beware if you try getting this working with Linux.

Being convionced I bought from Amazon, (second error I made), who very promptly delivered the device but with a German plug and no alternative for the UK even though no reference to this made by Amazon.The Installation CD would not even start to autorun or run from the executable file on it. It did advise that the Docking station software is not compatible with my operating system, (Windows 10). The Dell technician did not even mention this possibility in my pre sales request for help.I found that ""DisplayLink"" produce the graphics drivers and they were excellent and responded very promptly to help resolve the problem. Dell tech support responded 2 days after DisplayLink to tell me to try another department as my contracted support were not able to support peripherals! (Even though branded ""Dell""?)I still have a German plug and no manual etc as these are on the CD which wont run.Of course I could have sent it back to Amazon and they would have replaced it - presumeably with the same problems.Suggest you do look for an alternative and do check that Amazon realise you live in the UK and want a UK plug if you have it shipped to you in the UK and, of course, do check that it is compatible with your software!",1.0,2015-11-10,United Kingdom

R3J6K93CLHLWGJ,"I struggled in deciding how many stars to give.  I really didn't get on with this headset and ultimately returned it so 1 star, right?  No, not at all.In my view these are are well built, look good, Jabra software works nicely (Windows in my case), the red light when in use is surprisingly useful (mainly to others so they can see you're on a call), the sound quality isn't bad, and they are relatively comfortable.  So at least 4 stars then? Not quite ...Sound isolation/noise cancelling is where it all went a bit wrong for me.  It works - very well in fact.  Popping this headset on meant that the outside world largely disappeared but sadly this includes your own voice and this is just weird.  Jabra are obviously aware of this and have included a feature called ""Sidetone"".  With this feature enabled, your own voice is played into your headset as you speak.  You can control the volume of this Sidetone but no matter what volume I used, it just sounded really freaky to me.  There is a *very* slight delay (milliseconds) on the Sidetone sound but it's enough for me to truly hate this feature and ultimately return the item.So, if your use case is in a particularly noisy environment (call centre perhaps?), and if you are not particularly sensitive to hearing your own voice through the headset, I imagine that this model would be near perfect.If, like me, you are simply after a high quality headset for use in a quieter home environment then I'd recommend looking elsewhere.  For me, I have settled on the much cheaper Jabra Evolve 20 that I found lying around in a cupboard.  The sound isolation is much weaker meaning I can hear my own voice without Sidetone (which isn't offered on this cheaper model anyway), and the voice sound quality is adequate.3 stars it is then ! :-)",3.0,2021-08-19,United Kingdom

It comes with a little thin soft foam bag, which keeps it from getting knocked around in your laptop bag.The fancy features like lifting/lowering the mic to mute/unmute, and all the LEDs, only work in very specific apps even if you install the Jabra Direct software.

The headset itself has left and right punched into the ear pieces which are slightly padded.I'm finding the headset very slightly slippery on my head the bar at the top is thinner than most headphones so there's not a lot of grip. There doesn't appear to be a significant ability to adjust the size of the headband up top. The usb cable has an led which is red on both sides of it as it attaches to the computer.This is usable if you have a laptop but might not be so if you have this plugged in to a desktop machine. The led shows whether the system is muted or not.There are two methods available to mute or unmute the headset. The 1st is via a button on the front of the right hand speaker. The second method is by lifting the microphone boom upwards. At the moment the system is reporting to me a muted or unmuted status in the headphones as I lift or drop the microphone boom. This may appear useful but I'm sure it won't stop people being double muted in meetings.Using the headphones to listen to music or some videos the quality appears to be reasonable, so I don't expect there to be any issues using these for online meetings.There are four other buttons available on the headset on the side with the right hand speaker there is an aunt or end call button which I suspect is useful mainly for people in call centres.

R1J1N3CCQR0ED6,"A well-known company makes this headset, hence the high price as the headset is very well made and has a definite feel of quality on all the parts, when you hold it you will be able to tell that this is an excellent headset and will work exceptionally well.Having said this there are other headsets which are just as well made and of excellent quality but are far cheaper than these ones. So do shop around especially, as this set is corded, there is no Bluetooth so it has lots of limitations in that respect, in fact, this set is meant for Microsoft Teams or for a call centre, as you have a microphone which you pull down.I'm not a music geek so all I want is a good headset which has good voice quality and is easy to use without any difficult features, this headset does tick all of those boxes, I very much appreciate the noise cancelling feature, it works well. I am not sure if you can upload any updates for this headset, as it has no Bluetooth, but if I am wrong in this respect then no doubt someone will correct me, but in my view I cannot see how you can download any updates.When I used this set I can honestly say it was very comfortable and did not hurt my ears as the cushioned earpieces are very soft, but you can feel them though they don't hurt in any way, adjustment is simple as well and they stay over the ears really well, so top marks for this part, however, my only issue is the price, I think they are a bit too expensive if they were Bluetooth I would understand the price, but for corded headsets this is not cheap, having said that the blue tooth ones are even more expensive.As they are made a known company there tends to be a bit of a premium to pay, so if you want a good quality set and can afford the price then these are excellent, I am giving this headset four stars, also, if you want them for gaming the cord is too short, you need wireless ones, these are not good for that purpose.",4.0,2024-03-02,United Kingdom

Featuring advanced 3-mic call technology, this headset ensures that your voice is crystal clear on calls, reducing background noise significantly and enhancing the overall call experience. It's particularly useful for remote workers or anyone who spends a significant amount of time on conference calls via platforms like Zoom and Google Meet.The noise-cancelling feature of the Evolve2 40 SE is noteworthy, providing a focused listening environment by effectively blocking out background noise. This makes it ideal for use in busy office environments or home offices where controlling ambient noise is not always possible. The stereo sound quality is exceptional, offering rich audio that is perfect not only for calls but also for music and multimedia.Comfort is another area where this headset excels. Designed for prolonged use, the Evolve2 40 SE comes with cushioned ear cups and an adjustable headband that ensure a comfortable fit, even during long work sessions. The USB-C cable provides a reliable and fast connection to your computer or other devices, ensuring high-quality sound transmission without latency issues.However, as a wired headset, it does lack the flexibility of wireless models, which might be a drawback for users who prefer the freedom to move around while on calls. Additionally, the premium features and quality of the Jabra Evolve2 40 SE come with a higher price tag, which is worth considering based on your specific needs and budget.The Jabra Evolve2 40 SE Wired Noise-Cancelling Headset is a top-tier option for professionals who prioritize sound quality, call clarity, and comfort in their daily communications.

R1AL6CGNR5UYGK,"I have been using this for MS Teams and like it. I’ll address some negative aspects that I’ve read in another review first:* “Clamping force makes wearing for long periods uncomfortable and no way to adjust” – this headset is more closed C shaped than an open U shape so does push in slightly at the sides of the head which can’t be rectified although there is some limited headband/bar flex. It does feel comfortable between calls though when rested around the neck. The head bar length can be adjusted in size by sliding out the earphone pieces from the headband and this makes the size larger and it is padded but there is still the pushing in at the sides of the head that can be felt, although this is mild so bearable although I haven’t tested using this for many hours on end.* “Difficult to hear own voice (muffled), results in your having to talk louder” – this is the noise-cancelling earphones doing their job. The mono headset option might be better if you want to hear your own voice crisply rather than the stereo version which covers both ears. This is not an issue for me.* “Because the microphone only works on right side, then cable only sits on right side, which if you're right-handed interferes with using a mouse” – this is easy to fix with cable management but I get the point. It would have been easier to fix if the microphone was usable on both the right and the left side of the face but it isn’t, or if the headset was wireless.My own negative that I had is that when you mute/unmute this it says in your ear “muted”/”unmuted” which drowns out the Teams conversation so you might miss something during that second.There are plenty of positives of course with this though:* The sound and mic are quality as you’d expect from Jabra.* It’s noise-cancelling without cupping your ears, so your ears don’t get as hot when using for a long time like they would with other headsets with ear cushions that surround your ears (on-ear as opposed to over-ear).* The features work well. The mute/unmute can be done with moving the mic arm up or down, or with a button on the right earcup. The other buttons for volume or playing music are on the earcup too and are not overly complicated.* I can end the call easily by pressing the button on the outside of the right earcup whereas before I had to manoeuvre my mouse to click the leave button first, which can lead to those awkward few moments at the end of the call when you’ve said bye but not left yet.* It comes in a protective cloth pouch that protects the headset when not in use.All-in-all then 4-stars with a star knocked off for the “clamping”.⭐⭐⭐⭐🎧",4.0,2024-02-12,United Kingdom

R2FFNZ9UXNK62G,"Due to the ongoing train strikes, my partner often has to work from home and this often means having video meetings with other nurses and doctors, so i thought i would pick up this headset for her as it could be useful, especially during the school holidays when we have an 8 year old boy running around and jabbering away in the background.Being an on-ear design, the headset itself is actually quite compact and a lot slimmer than the over-ear style that require deep ear cups.The whole thing is made from very sturdy and high quality feeling plastics, with the exception of the sliding arms being made from Aluminium. The underside of the headband is extremely soft and comfortable on the head.Both the left and right ear pads are made from soft memory foam and are mounted to self-adjusting ear cup swivels, whilst hidden away inside are 40mm speakers.The right cup is also home to the microphone boom, which is fitted with 3 x MEMs microphone chips to ensure clear communication, even in noisier environments. When the boom is in the raised position, the mic will be automatically muted and will unmute when pulled down towards the mouth.The buttons are also located on this side, with a single button on the front towards the top that will also mute/unmute the mic. There are 3 buttons to the rear that are used to increase or decrease the volume, as well as forward and skip tracks forwards or backwards and to play and pause. Finally, you have a circular button in the centre of the right cup that can be used to answer or end calls.The headset connects to your computer, smartphone or tablet via a 145cm long cable fitted with a USB-C plug.You also have the option of downloading the Jabra Direct app to your computer, which will let you update any firmware on the set, as well as customise various settings.***** In The Box *****1 x Evolve2 40SE Headset1 x Felt Storage Pouch***** Conclusion *****This is my first experience of the Jabra brand and i have to say that overall i’m pretty impressed.The headset itself looks and feels quite premium, the speakers sound very good when listening to music and the microphone is nice and clear when video calling.My favourite feature has to be being able to mute the mic by simply raising the arm out of the way – this saves having to mess around trying to find a button, making it much more convenient.My only slight disappointment is the very basic felt/carpet style pouch, which doesn’t match the look of quality feel of the product. I would have much preferred some kind of hard shell type case for added protection – especially given that the headset isn’t particularly cheap, with the current asking price being £107.Other than that, i think the product itself is very good and definitely worth considering if you need a decent sounding headset for video and phone calls.",4.0,2024-02-07,United Kingdom

R2NQYP7JHXQVWA,"My partner was provided with the Jabra Evolve2 40 (USB A) headset by her work for video/audio conferences. I already own an older Jabra Evolve headset and some mpow headsets as they are cheap and work fine.I thought people should be aware of the shortcomings of the Evolve2 40 before bothering to buy them, which I wouldn't recommend. There are cheaper alternatives that are way better.They are heavy and uncomfortable. The earpads look thick but they aren't, they're thin and you can easily feel the plastic earpiece through them.The cable is way too short. It would be difficult to use these with anything but a laptop sitting on the desk directly in front of you and even then the cable feels short.  Also it's a hard wired USB cable so you can't use the headset on a mobile phone and PC. Therefore restricting their practicality. For the price they should have a USB puck and the headset have a standard 3.5mm jack that plugs into the puck.Changing volume and muting from the headset is very awkward with the buttons on the right hand earpiece. You inevitably press the wrong button and turn the volume up or down instead of muting.There's no manual in the box!The LEDs showing you're on an call are annoying and as others have said they make you look odd while on video calls.They aren't noise cancelling in any way I could tell. The earpads don't sit well anyway so you can easily hear surrounding noise regardless of any cancelling these may provide.They are a mic on the right hand side use only! Can't believe this. You cannot use these with the mic on the left hand side as it doesn't rotate sufficiently to allow it. So if you think you'll be able to get more cable if they plug into the left of your laptop, by having it come out of the left earpiece, you can't. This, for me, is astounding for a headset. Never seen a decent headset that can't have the mic on both sides.

The bottle is of limited capacity and I find I have to fill it twice per cleaning. That's no problem at all at home but may not be possible in a more public setting. On the other hand, the device is compatible with other bottles that match the threading so you could combine it with a larger water bottle you carry around for drinking. I find I end up with a fair amount of water on the toilet seat after using which, again, is hardly a deal breaker and easily wiped up but just making sure you are armed with all of the facts. There's no indicator on the device as to how much charge is remaining and I'd be devastated to run out mid-cleaning so I've been very cautious about charging it frequently. The manual does state you get 30 minutes out of a single charge which I imagine should keep you covered for weeks at a time",5.0,2025-02-16,United Kingdom

With people working from home a lot of the time this can be slightly inconvenient - I want to crack on with my job but then the customer has a video-conference call they need to attend and it's always when I need the power off!Having seen a great review of the Jackery 240 by another electrician I follow on Instagram I made the plunge and bought one. It is insanely useful for keeping my customers happy. I turn up and plug their internet router into this thing and they run all day with no interruptions to internet access.Goes easily into the van as it is small and lightweight and charges up when I get home ready to go again the next day. Build quality seems excellent and the cables that come with it are sturdy too.Information shown on the screen tells me how much power is being used and how much charge is left in the batteries.

R1K7T2Q94TZ2HF,"I now use two of these units to power my astrophotography gear one for the mount / cameras, the other to keep the laptop going, based on another unit I really didn't think the unit will sustain a good 12v supply and a 220v charge. They are well up to a mount powered for 4 - 5 hours and still have plenty of power left I'm usually down to around 60% at the end of a session, depending how charged the laptop was to begin with. Supply is both stable and steady which is essential for astro gear, no gradual creeping down to 11v that I used to see with an SLA battery, they also seem less prone to low temperatures.Update July 2023 - For astrophotography I am now running mount, cooled CMOS camera, focuser and automated dew control via a Pegasus powerbox. I ran for about 6 hours this week starting around 85% charge. By the end of the session the charge was down to 13% and voltage was down to round 11.7v (measured by the powerbox - not the Jackery).

R2648GNQTJBGS4,"Finally an easy backup power solution for household appliances that is both user friendly and so simple even a child can use.We live in the UK Peak District and usually get 2-3 blackouts per year anyway, that was before taking into account the current energy crisis as a result of the 2022 geopolitical situation. So this was something of a considered gamble, having grown weary of how messy, fussy and user unfriendly fuel generators still insist on being in order to operate safely.Tested this to run our wifi router for an entire afternoon, and later as a stress test to run my home office, consisting of 3x3w bulb standing lamp, DAB radio, iPhone w/ hotspot on USB charge, 15” laptop for email and word processing in dock, printer (mostly on standby) & 32” LED PC monitor. This ran the entire setup for 3 hours.Very versatile and doesn’t require any messy maintenance or extra converters/parts etc to use safely. Just literally unplug whatever you want to run from the mains and plug it back in to the standard UK plug socket on the front of the unit, press the little button by the display and then just carry on as normal, multi-plugs are fine too, so long as the load of connected electricals does not exceed 200w total.At £259 this 200w model isn’t cheap, but there are few things in the western world that are worse than a power cut, and this keeps those little conveniences running regardless. Once depleted, plug it in to the mains overnight with the charger provided and it’s ready to go again. As other reviewers have said, this does make a bit of a noise and emit a vague synthetic chemical smell when in use, as a fan will intermittently start up, akin to a high-end desktop PC, but this is probably unavoidable given the thermodynamics involved. At least this can be safely used indoors right next to whatever you need to power.Larger models are available (500 & 1000 watt) and I can now see the appeal of these, but will wait to see how this performs long term before purchasing another.",5.0,2022-11-01,United Kingdom

The Jackery 240 i consider a basic entry level ,ideal for LED lighting charging small tools and emergency power. Ideal forfor caravaners and outside pursuits. I not sure of the longevity of the Jackery i have only had the power station for two weeks. But all is working at the moment. I have a few minor issues/suggestions that Jackery could take up. First there is no dust cap on the DC output port. Second the A/C socket should be higher up where the light (swopped with the light)  to cater for larger plugs). Lastly a safety concern the A/C outlet should have a RCD socket especially as a lot of customers  will be using the station outside.

R2CXEKDMWYT6MX,"The Jackery 240 is a decent piece of kit and it outputs 230v reliably.  There are lots of glowing reports on here, most of which are pretty spot on, but there are a few  niggly things that are worth mentioning from my experience of it.1: You manually turn on each power source,  12v, USB or 230v with a little button next to each socket.  Each source consumes power to do its own inversion. For example the 230v inverter draws 10w even before you plug anything in.  If you forget to turn it off when you've done it sits there drawing 10w until the battery is flat.  It should really have an auto off function. I can imagine many unhappy campers waking up to a flat battery because they forgot to turn it off.2: The fan is quite noisy, and kicks in once you start to draw around 70w+3: The supplied charger is quite slow, max 60W so takes a good 4-5 hours to charge up from flat.  I have seen videos online showing it charging at 100W with other PSU's so it's a bit tight of the manufacturer to only include a 60W PSU at this price.4: the 230v socket (on the UK model) is situated right at the bottom of the unit. Because most UK plugs have cable strain relievers on, when you plug in, the plug strain reliever protrudes beyond the bottom of the Jackery, so you cant have the Jackery stood on its 4 feet and have to tilt it back, making it unsteady, not ideal.I am not disappointed with this purchase, as it does everything I needed it to do, but just wanted to give other potential buyers some considerations that I didn't have before I hit the buy it now button.",4.0,2022-03-29,United Kingdom

R2TG8W5L52W94Z,"Advertised as charging off of USB-C, but appears to need a voltage higher than 5v to charge (e.g. 9v, 12v etc). This means that one of your solar chargers you probably already have wont work to charge this up since they output at 5v.  Very annoying.When you do connect a larger panel, the unit appears to turn on and connect to the internet etc at even the very smallest amount of light hitting the panel, so it seems to use more power than it gains on cloudy/winter days, so it will discharge by 2 to 3% per day for me when the app says it is only getting 3 or 4 watts from the solar panel.  It would be nice if it could be in a deeper state of hibernation or something when the solar input is low so this does not occur.Otherwise app connection seems decent enough and appears to use Google Firebase (I expected Tuya or something) so is reliable and responsive and you can connect to it from your phone when you are not at home - I have mine connected to my house's wifi from the bottom end of the garden in the shed, so I can keep an eye on it from the house.

R13J75HBSNLFRV,"Two main things. On the front of the box it says 'Solar Generator' but no solar lead included. Very strange. It has a 12 volt cig lighter charger, a 240 lead mains charger, bit you have to buy your own solar panel cable and connectors. Second thing is it is adapted from the European or USA model where the 230 volt pure sine waver comes out. In Europe and USA it comes straight out, but for the uk, the plug lead exits at the bottom of the plug, meaning it can put pressure on the plug lead unless you raise it. Plug should be fitted  to 90 degrees to allow clearance, though as a lithium battery you can lay it down on its back. Third .... I know I said two, but there is a third, the lack of a usb c 3 and pd 3 usb connector would be useful these days. It only has two usb A 5v 2.4A plugs which is great for most connections, not super fast, but great. Good though is it comes with an MPPT solar controller built in and a pure sine wave inverter. Fab. I understand, yet to try, that the 12 volt, 10 amp cig lighter continously gives the correct voltage and does not drop, which is great. Will test that out, means I can use my portable 12 volt fridge without it cutting out when it drops below 12.2 volts.All in all a great little unit.

R1FKW0ZROCVGSG,"Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 240, Oct 2022] Arrived the next day which was a nice surprise. Switched it on and it was already on 48% power, which seemed a bit odd. I then boosted it up to 100%.The main purpose of buying it was to power my home (standard type) router in case of a power cut - we get a few round here. i.e. I need to keep the internet on 24/7. Early tests indicate that the battery can run itself PLUS the router for 1hr 45 mins on 10% (i.e. dropped from 100% to 90%). I'm pleased with this as I'm not expecting a power cut of more than 3-4 hours.In a separate test – my Android phone was on 1%, powering it up to 85% [plus powering the Jackery itself] took 7% of the Jackery’s energy. This used more energy than I was expecting, but acceptable. Recharging the phone is usually rapid, this time it was quite slow.I am expecting (hoping) - if I have to face a 4-hour power cut – I’ll manage easily to recharge (1) a laptop (2) a couple of mobile phones (3) a portable light and (4) power the router. With a bit of luck the Jackery will last for 5 or 6 years of occasional use (I'll try and ensure optimal conditions), but I may be being optimistic - we'll see. I will update if any further developments.July 2024: It's still working, but only had cause to use it once seriously (though I have done 3 or 4 tests to check it is still working OK).

I am an aviation enthusiast, I go to airports and log aircraft registrations (Tail-numbers) of aircraft I have seen.  The Jackery 240 is now a complete game changer for me.  Before the Jackery, I took my laptop, and lots of spare batteries as it runs a program via a radar box that runs a ""virtual radar"" on screen of aircraft around me for about 60 miles all around. I can see what is approaching from miles away, landing, taking off and overhead at cruising altitude and it records what I have seen. I have plugged my Laptop, which is also powering my USB powered ""Radar Box"" into the Jackery using the 12v outlet as a simulated test as a totally remote unit, as it would be if I was in the field at Myrtle Avenue (Hounslow, Heathrow) before I can finally get out for real after lockdown, and down to Heathrow for a days spotting.I am pleased to say that the 12v car charger running my laptop and ""Radar Box"" at a combined constant drain rate of 28w, using 10% of the Jackery power per hour, which is around 8 hours, down to the last 20% of the Jackery battery and as a bonus if my laptop battery is 100% charged before I start, that will give me an extra 2 hours once the Jackery gets down to its bottom 20%. That is a full days spotting, and if the weather is sunny, I have a 120w fold out Solar panel to keep the Jackery topped off for extended use for a few more hours, especially if my laptop, etc is drawing 28w and the Solar input is around 60wOverall, I am very impressed, a fantastic piece of kit.

R2ECPPAZBRHUS8,"For a while, I've been wanting to try one of these so called ""portable power stations"" in my home audio set-up, so I finally took the plunge.I've had the Explorer 240 for about a week, during which time, I've been exclusively using the AC output. So far, I've only completed one charge-discharge cycle, running the remaining charge down to 14% with 7:10 use with a 17W load, plus 1:55 with a 49W load - that comes to about 216Wh from 86% of the unit's capacity, which is consistent with the manufacturer's claims.In absolute terms, it's hardly lightweight, at 3kg, but considering the number of cells inside it, that weight is tolerable and besides, for me, it's a non-issue because mine is a static application.My only niggle, at this stage, is the fan noise, which can be intrusive when listening to music. To be fair, it's probably no louder than the fan noise from a typical desktop PC when it's doing something a bit more strenuous than just web browsing, and it's easy enough to resolve; I just need to use an extension cable and I can put the unit in the next room and close the door.I'm pretty happy I took the plunge.",4.0,2021-05-22,United Kingdom

R1VW3EGEUMV5TI,Reviewed in conjunction with the solar panel additionI'm really happy with this. It's expensive and so is the solar panel but it is very well made ( get what you pay for? ) and it appears to work really well.Early days but I'm getting 11w input with cloud ( output on my phone is about 7 ) so even with a cloud I appear to be making more than I lose by charging a mobile )When I plugged it into the mains I was getting about 64w input and I'm getting so far best of 69w input from the sun...so it appears to load it with more power from the sun than I get from my mains electricity when charging..Any shadow on the solar panel does have a significant and immediate effect on the input which seems logical but worth avoiding even a shadow on one corner...Would I buy it again if I had the choice to go back? YES I think it's great and a great addition to a leisure battery on my camper van..I decided to have this separate to adding solar to the van because it gives me more versatility and so if we just want to go camping with a tent we could still easily power a portable cool box and pump up Paddle boards with an electric pump.,5.0,2021-06-23,United Kingdom

The Jackery took around four days to deplete and was used daily. I’ve got a small solar panel that I could charge it up with if I was staying longer. My only regret is that for my needs, I should have gone for the 500 watt version but the 240 is great, especially if you can charge it from solar panels whilst away. I was looking at a few different brands of power stations but are happy that I probably chose the best.",5.0,2021-05-18,United Kingdom
R2O7AM6TY6I9YK,"Purchased to be used in case of power outages for low power appliances.  The device arrived well packed and is very easy to set up and charge.  It's well built, and I've used it for both USB, 12v and the mains outputs and all work well.  As an experiment I even used the 230v output to power a valve radio!  To my surprise the 230v output is such a pure sine wave, the radio worked well with no interference.  These devices are expensive for what they are, but.. would you trust a cheaper device to actually do what you want safely, and reliably?",5.0,2022-12-31,United Kingdom

R3FDA9GA0RX4Y2,"Bought this for camping, as we struggled on a 5 day camp with just normal power banks recently. With phones, watches, tent lights, and a SUP pump this is going to be perfect. We are already using it at home as well though. Charging it on a Sunday and using it all week for ad hoc needs. Plus I’ve had it outside while we were in the garden. It charges so quickly at home, and the car adapter is going to be perfect for camping. Excellent excellent product!",5.0,2023-07-26,United Kingdom
R10V9H1BMYXNFE,"I loved this product. We stayed on a small farm and were able to use our TV all evening without a generator or inverter. I think we need to try more ""off-grid"" locations now. We bought the smallest version of the Jackery as it was light to carry and easy to store in a small space. The only problem was the 3 pin socket was rather low to plug British appliances in. We got around this by using an adapter, but I suppose you could put something under the front edge to lift it slightly. We were able to charge it the next day from our onboard battery which is charged via our solar panel. Solar panels are available from Jackery for use with this unit. Great for charging your mobile devices e.g. phones, laptops, drones, cameras etc.",5.0,2021-11-05,United Kingdom
R1X66KP7AZWO52,Waited a while to get one of these. Going camping soon with a electric hookup so I’d thought I’d get one when they were on offer.I understand that the main 240/110 outlet is interchangeable for different types of lug and voltages around the word but why on earth put It where is is. 12v the same around the world. UK plug sockets have a wire coming out of the bottom of the plug. Come on Jackery swap the 12v over with the 240 outlet in the next model.,4.0,2022-07-19,United Kingdom

We regularly camp without electric hook up but usually have to rely on charging phones in pubs etc. We can now still go to the pub but don't have hunt around for power sockets.The Jackory 240 has kept two phones charged plus other devices like torches and watches over a 6 day holiday. Started on 100% and by the end of the week only dropped to 30% with every day use, I think at a push it could do 7 or 8 days before recharging.Really worth the expense and really handy size, with the option to charge it from the car if you have any daily trips planned.",5.0,2022-10-13,United Kingdom

I had already checked this was charged - I fully charged it in December and by February it was still at 100% - result. Router and wifi hub plugged into this with an extension cable for the extra sockets, and I was back online. This would run both devices for 10 hours and keep my online, and although I did not need to, I could have recharged it with my electric car. Paid for itself on the first use.

Also the display shows you the power out.  The Jackery supports pass though charging.  With four out let’s I powered many devices at the same time and the Jackery handled it with ease.  It also has a power meter that shows the battery percentage, very useful as not all solar generators are able to do this.  I haven’t looked at solar at the moment, but if the portable panel is as good as the power station, I want one.  Well when I can afford it.

Having looked at jackery reviews and against other batteries seemed like a reliable company selling a genuine product. And I am so happy with it ..  from flat takes about a night to completely charge on mains and can easily used it for hours at a time charging my phone and with the lights on in my van. The battery’s shows how many watts it is currently powering which allows you to easily adjust how you use it if it getting low.

R3PZP1VVHOG9GQ,I bought this to be able to simply be run broadband and phone in the result of a power cut - especially as we now have digital voice that requires power for the phone to work unlike the old analogue lines. Tested recently when we had some electrical work done that switched off the power for about 6 hours and kept the internet and phone alive with around 30% battery left.

And unlike a dedicated leisure battery it has the benefit of being able to take it out the van / use in the garden etc. too.I got this with a view to getting a higher capacity version for some more off-grid trips away / wild camping.

Well, it lasted just over 4 hours, not even enough to keep it going overnight with no solar charge! Now I get that to find out how long things last, you divide 240 by whatever the power consumption is on your device. So 240 divided by 58 is 4.1 so it will last 4.1 hours. Know this before you buy.

R1ZB9XKMR1ZZV3,"These gloves are excellent! I originally bought them for 3D printing, as many companies recommend nitrile gloves when handling 3D-printed resins. When working with resin, especially liquid resins and Isopropanol alcohol, it is crucial to have reliable gloves, and these do the job perfectly. The fit is incredible; they feel like a second skin, making tasks like removing supports from 3D prints a breeze. The textured surface ensures a firm grip, even when handling slippery or delicate objects, while their stretchability enhances dexterity and control. Whether you are working with intricate parts or handling liquids, these gloves give you a secure and confident hold.While I initially expected them to be thinner due to the price, I was pleasantly surprised. They are thick enough to offer serious protection but not so thick that they limit movement. I have used them with both liquid resin and Isopropanol, and they have never torn, punctured, or shown any signs of degradation during use. Their puncture resistance is a significant advantage, especially when working with sharp tools or rough materials.Although I originally bought these for single use, they are definitely strong enough to be reused multiple times, depending on the task. If I am just cleaning or doing light work, I wash them with soap while still wearing them, turn them inside out to dry, and they are good to go for another use. This makes them even more cost-effective. We always keep a box of these gloves in the house, as they are perfect for everything from scrubbing the oven and cleaning the toilet to handling my cat's litter tray, food preparation, first aid, or any task that requires thorough hand protection. I recently started using them when cleaning my water filtration system to avoid contamination, and they work perfectly for that as well.The fit is excellent too. I have large hands, and the large size fits me well, though they are slightly tight, which I prefer because it gives me more control over what I am doing. I would estimate they are about a size 9, which is perfect for my hands. They are also latex-free, so they do not irritate my skin at all, which is a huge bonus for anyone with allergies or sensitivities.Another great feature is how easy they are to put on and take off. Even after wearing them for an extended period, they do not stick to my skin, and there is no hassle when it comes to removing them. I have had gloves in the past that became difficult to remove after long use, but not these.For £5.75 for a box of 100 large gloves, the value for money is outstanding. The quality is on par with, if not better than, more expensive brands I have tried. The packaging was sturdy and secure, and you can actually remove one glove at a time from the box without pulling out a clump. These gloves are definitely some of the best I have used. If you are looking for reliable, durable, and versatile nitrile gloves for any task, whether it is 3D printing, cleaning, food prep, or messy jobs around the house, I cannot recommend these highly enough!Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope that you found it helpful and that it assists you in your decision-making. I try to be as honest and fair as possible, as those have always been the reviews that helped me the most.",5.0,2024-09-28,United Kingdom

RIM3GEWRRTBYE,"Good quality, only one glove has ripped while putting it on. I bought these for domestic use...chopping meat, cleaning cat tray, general cooking prep, clearing out the Dyson when full etc.  As a daily user of PPE at work I feel I know good and bad quality gloves when I use them, and these gloves in my view are good quality and would recommend. My only concern is that the box is not in any packaging and Amazon dispatch just put their shipping sticker on the box. This is not a problem for me but if you need the gloves for clinical use then just bear in mind that the box will be covered in microorganisms due to the delivery chain, regardless of any claim Amazon may make of of hygiene standards. You don't what the courier has been touching before handling the box.",5.0,2025-03-26,United Kingdom

I don’t like them. They’re like a shocking pink colour. It didn’t matter too much, I only use them for cleaning at home but if you want them to look subtle as part of a uniform-you may be surprised at the totally different colour.The glove on the left-this is how they usually look.

R31RLEAO2ZIK8M,"I'm always a little dubious about buying latex gloves, as I've found that the quality and fit can vary dramatically , so size L in one make may be a tight fit and another make too baggy. Higher prices don't necessarily reflect quality & quantity, so I was pleasantly surprised when I first use this make. Having ""normal sized"" hands, I found size L are a good fit and easy to get on and off with this make. As I use them mainly for working on car car or boat engines, I'm happy if they last for one job, as they will be usually be pretty mucky by the time I finish so consider them as one-use disposable. These seem reasonably rugged, but I've yet to find nitrile gloves that that are not prone to snagging when used for mechanical work although they seem more rugged than latex gloves - I doubt that is a problem when used for medical or other less demanding purposes.

R3TWFPFY563AGG,"I've never had these gloves tear on me at all, they're a pretty good quality; I've ordered them a few different times.If you have eczema or any skin condition, I would highly recommend them. I haven't found any aggravating layer or powder inside, nothing on it has bothered my skin, and unlike rubber gloves they maintain a strong sense of tactility. If you are using them for eczema however I would highly recommend wearing a pair of cotton gloves inside of them, to prevent the sweat build-up from aggravating your skin.If you ARE an eczema sufferer in particular, or have easily irritated skin, try wearing these when you wash your hair. I like to apply a layer of zinc cream (a.k.a., nappy cream) inside of the gloves sometimes, to add an extra layer of protection for my skin, and then I wash my hair etc. After any business involving soap or SLS-containing products is done in the shower or bath I then take off the gloves and wash my hands clean with an eczema friendly soap or aqueous cream. :)I've never had these gloves tear on me either. I recommend them highly. It WOULD be nice if they were just a little longer, though, up the wrist to prevent leaking inside (e.g., for this reason they can be less than ideal for washing dishes). But they're otherwise very good.",5.0,2024-11-11,United Kingdom

I'm wondering if these 2 packs are old stock that was at the back of the warehouse as I never had this problem before with any gloves, this brand or others. At first I thought I'd just caught my glove on something but nope. It's not enough of them to warrant complaining and asking for my money back, but I am considering changing my order in future to a different type.I'm still giving 4 stars as usually this brand is great, but if this turns out to be more of a problem than just those 2 boxes I may come back and change that.",4.0,2024-11-05,United Kingdom

For the width of fingers, I don’t think a medium will work for most men because they don’t stretch well and without the aid of any powder, the surface has too much friction to slide across skin when putting them on.",4.0,2024-08-12,United Kingdom

Never had black before but for the sale price I cannot complain.These are thinner than others I have used but this may be because they fit ""like a glove"" and I am not feeling double on my finger tips.

The material is soft and lightweight, making them perfect for running around at the park or just lounging at home. The cushioned footbed provides great support, which is important for little feet still growing.The durability of these clogs is impressive as well. They can handle all sorts of activities, from playing outside in the mud to splashing around at the pool. I've noticed they clean up easily, too—just a quick rinse and they're as good as new!I also love the variety of colors available. We went with a vibrant pink, and they look adorable! The classic design is versatile and pairs well with many outfits, making them suitable for casual outings, playdates, or even family gatherings.The ventilation holes are a great feature as well, allowing airflow to keep feet cool and preventing odor buildup. My child loves the ease of slipping them on and off, which encourages independence.Overall, I highly recommend the Crocs Unisex Kids Classic Clogs for any parent looking for a reliable, comfortable, and stylish footwear option for their little ones.

R1U1KJZB47ZBJD,"Sizing for these is confusing, hope this helps. According to the chart, J4 corresponds to EU36-37, uk size 3.5-4.

I’d say if you’re slightly over a uk 4, or want to wear with thick socks or a liner, J4 will be too small. No need to size up for wide feet.",5.0,2024-10-13,United Kingdom

RMQEO6KNX2DSU,"Brilliant bit of kit.I use the power bank when I'm out flying my drones, so i can keep charged out on the go. Since ive been using it its never ran out on me while ive been out, the capacity is great. Both the power bank and dock have excellent build quality and feel like they could take a beating. Anker have also included an app that helps you monitor your charging and also gives a few extra features like power saving modes where the device will charge at a slower rate between low usage times to improve battery life.The dock is a fantastic addition to have on your desk. (where mine lives) its multi function of both a charger for your power bank but also the addition of two USBC ports and a single USB port give it useful functionality besides just doing one or the other.Unfortunately like many other manufacturers they have decided to add that textured feel design along the sides of the power bank. meaning there are many small valleys and peaks where dust and dirt is attracted and then accumulates, if you work or take the device to dirty environments this can become frustrating as its not often the easiest to clean. not sure why manufacturers are obsessed with using this design. its not a big issue but i know it frustrates me so maybe it does others.",5.0,2024-09-01,United Kingdom
R1M6T5XV1Q6YWW,"Brilliant piece of kit from Anker. Design, functionality and build quality is excellent. A bit weighty, but forgivable for such a versatile power bank. It charged my Surface Book 2 through a small adaptor with no hassle whatsoever, something I was not able to do with my other units. Now I only need this and my GaN wall charger instead of different charging bricks. Recharge speed from a normal USB-c charger or wall socket is slow, which is expected but with a GaN charger at 100w it was a rapid process. This is a premium device and, in my opinion, well worth the money. A GaN 100w charger would be a worthwhile investment, along with 100w capable cables, which would complement this outstanding piece of kit.",5.0,2024-10-14,United Kingdom
RU4GUT73IW68V,"Having this amount of power in a completely portable box is super handy. It has more than enough capacity to fully charge my MacBook (and at full speed too) with spare juice for other things.Build quality is great and I appreciate the inclusion of the soft bag to store it in. It has been crashing around in the bottom of my bag for months and doesn’t have any damage. It is pretty heavy, but if you want a battery this huge, you signed up for it.The screen is a bit of a gimmick but gives you peace of mind that you’re getting full speeds. The app is even more excessive but I suppose the “Find My” functionality might come in handy one day.Stays fairly cool during both charging and discharging at full speed. My unit is still at 100% capacity after 6 months of usage which is promising.Definitely recommend if you need a fast and high capacity power bank for working on the go.",5.0,2024-10-07,United Kingdom
R12Y6N4BULH0ZJ,"Fast charging and discharging, it easily powers my MacBook (65 watts) , S23 Ultra (45 watts)  and iPhone 15 Pro (29 watts) at full speed at the same time without getting anywhere near the insane 250 watts maximum discharge it is advertised to be capable of. The power bank itself is the largest you can take on an aeroplane without explicit permission from the airline (This stores 99.5 watt hours of energy, the maximum allowed is 100 watt hours).The bluetooth connected app is good and you can input the battery size of your devices to get an accurate indication of how many times the Power Bank can charge these devices before running flat. This is displayed on the powerbank's screen to view whenever needed.A nice surprise compared to my old Anker 737 is that this allows pass through charging so you can charge the powerbank and also any devices connected to it at the same time.I have just finished charging this power bank from 0 to 100 percent with two cables to get close to the max charging speed of 170 watts,  one from a 100 watt charger , and another from my laptop charger which charges at 65 watts. It surprisingly did not get too warm, maxing out at 41c during its torture test, in normal scenarios with one cable I barely see higher than ambient temperature.Using two cables, I managed a charge time from 0 to 94 percent in 32 minutes and  0 to 100 percent in 37 minutes (it slows down to 64 watts charging when almost full).A fully charged power bank will charge your iPhone 15 Pro 5.4 times or a S23 Ultra 3.6 timesDefinitely recommended if you travel a lot and in need of constant power that can be replenished quickly, but it is expensive (£150)",5.0,2023-12-19,United Kingdom
R3DLX0TD0L921D,"Super powerful and charges laptops, tablets, cameras phones (basically anything) with juice to spare.My only gripe is that the front panel is like a glossy plastic; it looks great but I know as soon as I put it face down on a surface it'll scratch horribly. I don't think its a tough glass, I think its only plastic but I wont use it without it being in the little soft pouch it comes with as I'm certain it will instantly scratch up.Maybe if it had a raised plastic lip around the edge but as it is I have to take the pouch everywhere which is a bit of a faff that I dont have to do with any other battery bank.Basically its really good value for money but I wish I could be a little more 'rough' with it.",4.0,2024-09-29,United Kingdom
RN7QV55U3QCOW,"The Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank is a powerhouse in the realm of portable charging solutions. Its robust capacity, smart features, and versatility make it an essential accessory for anyone needing reliable power on the go. After extensive use, this power bank proves to be a top-tier option, offering both convenience and efficiency.Battery Capacity and Power OutputThe most prominent feature of the Anker Prime is its substantial 27,650mAh battery capacity. This allows for multiple charges of various devices without frequent recharging of the power bank itself. For example, it can charge an iPhone 15 up to six times, making it perfect for long trips, heavy usage days, or emergency situations. The 250W total output power ensures rapid charging for all connected devices, efficiently distributing power to maximize charging speed.Port Configuration and CompatibilityThis power bank is equipped with three ports: two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. This configuration offers flexibility and compatibility with a wide range of devices, including the latest iPhone 15/14/13 series, Samsung phones, Dell laptops, AirPods, and more. The intelligent power distribution ensures that each device receives the optimal charging speed, reducing overall charging time.Smart App IntegrationA standout feature of the Anker Prime is its smart app integration. The dedicated app allows users to monitor the power bank’s status, including real-time battery levels, charging status, and detailed power usage statistics. This smart feature enhances the user experience by providing comprehensive control and insights into the charging process, ensuring users are always aware of their power bank’s status and performance.Design and Build QualityThe design of the Anker Prime is both sleek and functional. Despite its large capacity, the power bank maintains a relatively compact profile but it is quite heavy. The build quality is excellent, with durable materials that withstand everyday wear and tear. The design is modern and aesthetically pleasing, fitting seamlessly with other tech gadgets. Safety features such as overcharge protection, short circuit prevention, and temperature control are built-in, ensuring both the power bank and connected devices are protected.Performance and EfficiencyPerformance-wise, the Anker Prime delivers impressive results. It charges devices quickly, thanks to its high power output and efficient power management. The power bank’s ability to charge multiple devices simultaneously without significant loss in charging speed is particularly useful. Whether charging a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, the Anker Prime consistently provides reliable and swift power delivery.Value for MoneyConsidering its high capacity, smart features, and versatile port options, the Anker Prime offers excellent value for money. It’s a worthwhile investment for anyone needing a reliable and powerful portable charger. The inclusion of a smart app and robust safety features further adds to its value, making it a comprehensive solution for on-the-go charging needs.",5.0,2024-05-30,United Kingdom

I bought this as an upgrade for my ageing Anker power bank and it’s worth the money, the screen and associated app shows you charging speeds and what not, is really cool to see and the performance is great, it will charge your devices as fast as is safely possible, also for laptop users it can charge at 140-170w depending on how many cables you use to charge so it’s full speed charging on those too. It’s a little bit on the bulky side but it easily fits inside my backpack to go abroad and for those travelling by plane it is within the international aviation regulations for safe carriage of batteries so no need to get prior approval before taking it abroad.",5.0,2024-06-04,United Kingdom

It’s not intuitive and is frustrating to useHeavy brick3 outputsMassively overpriced (even at discount)Fingerprint magnetAdditional cost for charging dockBluetooth connectivity can be an issueSeems to drain very quickly - Anker Solix devices are a better option at price point (however may not be suitable for travel such as air travel/travelling light)I usually like Anker products, but I regret buying this device.  I don’t really think that it is fit for purpose, and think there are many sponsored reviews that are ‘bigging’ this up, when it is actually not worth the outlay, with far better options at similar price points.I would consider an Anker Solix c200 as a better alternative to this unit if you don’t need to take your power bank on a plane or are less concerned about bulk.I really cannot recommend this device in all honesty.

I've had the Anker Prime 27,650mAh for almost a year now, and it's become my trusty companion on every trip and outing.Here's what I love about it: * Ultra-Fast Charging:  With two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, I can juice up my PS Portal, phone, Switch, and other devices simultaneously at lightning speed. No more fighting over charging cables! * Massive Capacity: This thing is a tank! The 27,650mAh capacity means I can go days without needing to recharge the power bank itself. Perfect for long journeys or festivals. * Durable Build: It's a bit bulky, but that's because it's built like a tank. I've accidentally dropped it a few times, and it's still going strong without a scratch. * Anker Charging Base (a MUST BUY!):  Grab the Anker charging base for this – it charges the power bank back up insanely fast. Seriously, it's a game-changer. * Bluetooth and App Connectivity: The Anker app is surprisingly useful. You can monitor battery levels, customize charging settings, and even update the firmware (which I highly recommend, as it improved my battery life).A couple of minor niggles: * Fingerprint Magnet: The glossy front panel attracts fingerprints like crazy. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such an awesome power bank.Overall, the Anker Prime 27,650mAh is an absolute winner.

The build quality is phenomenal, the speed it can recharge is insane, almost 40 minutes from 0-100% using the matching dock and a separate anker 100w wall charger. It can easily power my laptop, phone and tablet at the same time without breaking a sweat.It's a little heavy but to be expected for something with this kind of capacity and punch.In short, absolutely delighted and don't regret my investment!",5.0,2025-02-11,United Kingdom
R1UUSEKHUC0ZSV,"I have a couple of power banks for charging devices when out and about, and I recently bought a MacBook so I wanted something as an emergency to keep it going if needed. When this arrived I was impressed it's well made and the digital display is great at giving you all of the information you need. It's a chunky charger that is easy to carry around but isn't light.I fully charged it and ran down the 2024 M4 MacBook Pro to 10%. I plugged in the charger and it got to 86% on the MacBook before it was empty. It was quite quick at doing this and is a good piece of kit.However, for me, unless speed was the goal, I didn't need to spend this much as there were much cheaper power banks that would charge my MacBook. Maybe not as quick and slightly less power. But enough to warrant not paying as much.All in all, it's a good piece of kit, but bear in mind what you want to charge from it: phones and anything else like that its going to be fantastic.",3.0,2025-02-05,United Kingdom

I bought mainly to use for my 4080 laptop to make it more mobile instead of using mains power. It powers the laptop but unfortunately will only last around an hour before the power bank is drained completely. I then have to use the laptop battery which also only last about an hour.

R1081U10F95QET,This is everything I need. Powers my laptop for hours - not long enough to go totally discharged. The laptop pulls between 10 and 40 watts based on a led cable with a display.This should run tablets for many many hours quite easily. It'll recharge phones in a jiffy. I've tried it on my S24 phone. Totally nice.I can recharge it from a USB high-powered charger at about 66 watts which is quite good enough. Most times it never discharges more than 50%.It came with USB C cable and a nice soft bag which fits snuggly with a draw string. But highly recommended is a hard case as well. Got that. I overjoyed.Oh I had the previous lower powered model that went dead. Anker as always stood by their produce with in the warranty period and refunded that one. So go this one as an upgrade for a few quid more.Great product Anker - great service. That's what build customer loyalty.Close your eyes and buy this.,5.0,2024-11-11,United Kingdom
R3B2YN7KW8TI7E,"I have the older, 24,000 mAh version of this charger and bought this one as a additional charger. Unfortunately, I have had some problems with it.I love Anker devices and buy them in preference to most brands. They are usually safe, reliable and well designed. This device is safe and well designed, but I didn’t find it reliable. The older power bank had one bidirectional USB C port for charging the power bank and for charging other devices, and a second USB C port just for charging other devices. For the new power bank both USB C ports are bidirectional. The advantage is that you can charge the power bank using either socket, which is less confusing. However, in practice, I quickly got used to which port to use with the older power bank. The disadvantage is that the new power bank gets confused it you want to use it to charge up a smaller device that also acts as a power bank. I have a number of devices, such as a magsafe power bank, that are designed to charge other items and on holiday, I frequently top them up with the older 24,000mAh Anker power bank. I couldn’t use this new power bank as it just wouldn’t charge them. I am thinking it was confused about which way charging was required. I understand there is a phone app that can be used to control the new power bank, which the old one didn’t have, but I don’t want to have to mess around with an app whenever I want to charge.Added to that, I found that the second USB socket came up with an overvoltage warning and stopped charging the power bank if I tried to charge it with a high power charger. Both this and the older power bank can be charged up to 140w, which is really quick. However, I found that the second USB C socket claims overvoltage and stops charging once the power exceeds 85w or so.This certainly won’t put me off Anker devices, as I have several and the others are great, but this one was returned for a refund. I suspect it wasn’t yet ready for release.",3.0,2024-05-25,United Kingdom

This product really struggles on low power draw items, it just can’t recognise below a certain amount and it just stops. The ports also struggle to differentiate between input and output (although you can’t change this on the app)Finally, if you look around, unless you absolutely NEED the capability to both charge the device and charge your own devices at 140w, this is a very expensive product.

This 27mah model is only half as much weight again, is not that much bigger and outputs well over twice as much power. It can cope with mulple devices at once. Better still the display can be changed to display volts, amps and watts. The app (which for some reason is not avalable for the smaller models) is a nice addition. With the optional (it isn't really that optional) base charger unit the 100W charge (only if nothing else if charging from the base frustratingly) fills this up in just under an hour (my old non-Prime 12mah battery took 6 hours!) If this isn't fast enough, plug in two 100W chargers and you'll easily halve this time. Talking of time, this also has the option to permanently display the time. Sturdy.

R36CK7EAO3TD9E,"I needed a power bank that could charge my drone batteries in the field and whilst on the move - It charges them at the max rate I get from my 200W wall charger (36W) and is only limited by the batteries ability to take the charge. It can charge all of the drone devices at once - so 2 batteries (one in the drone & the others in the hub) & the controller no problem. This setup allows my 5 batteries to be fully recharged from a single charge of the powerbank, so effectively gives me 10 batteries for a days use and another 5 batteries would be £300 and the powerbank was £150 and more versatile as I can charge any other mobile device. It re-charges fast if you have the power to re-fill it. I use my 200W mains charger which has 6 outputs, 2 are 65W max, 4 x 25W - but you can use the 2 USBC ports as inputs as well as outputs so if I plug in 2 high power USB C cables I can easily get 140W re-charge and then it can fully recharge the powerbank in an hour!! I love the built in display showing voltage, ampage etc - I usually use inline devices to get this info from my other power banks.  If you just want a powerbank to re-charge your phone or tablet then this is overkill, but if you need to power a laptop or drone batteries then this is what you need.",5.0,2024-05-16,United Kingdom

R7EWZWL3O6HT9,"My 737 powerbank died not too long ago, which was an unpleasant surprise, especially considering the outlay it demanded. Anyhow, having really found the fast charging (including the powerbank) extremely convenient, i decided to take my chances on this improved version. It's capacity of 99.54Wh is a 12Wh improvement over the 737, and is pretty much nearing the limit for travelling abroad. It takes noticeably longer to charge at the full 140W compared to the 737, but the fact it goes from 0-100 in less than an hour is really convenient.It seemed all sunshine and rainbows, and all set to go, until I noticed an extremely high pitched sound being emitted from the powerbank when its charging past 80%. Never come across something like this before, and when i say it's extremely high pitched, i'm talking about 16khz, and if you want to give that a listen, it's on youtube, but you'll probably thank me later for NOT doing that. It's very uncomfortable for my ears, and I can't imagine how bad it would be if you were suffering from tinnitus.Could be a faulty unit, but i'm sending my unit back. There's no way i'm going to be able to cope with about 10 minutes of that noise, every time i'm topping the powerbank back up (starts around the 80% mark for some reason). I have 2 140W apple chargers (one i got from CEX for £30) and it's able to charge right up to the 170W limit. This is all really enticing for someone who might have never tried a charger like this, but with the issue presented, it's a hard pass for me.Also, not liking where Anker have been heading with their prices - nearly 200 for a charger?!? I guess it's unique functionality of being able to be topped up within 50 mins, is a big plus, when other chargers would take a full night's length to charge fully, but it's not worth TWICE the amount of the 737 by all means!",3.0,2023-12-07,United Kingdom

R1Y1BO7ZMVHYPB,"I've always been a fan of Anker products, and the Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank is no exception. Right out of the box, the build quality is impressive. It feels sturdy, well-made, and ready to stand up to the daily grind.Now, the standout feature, in my opinion, is the Bluetooth functionality. Initially, I was a bit skeptical, thinking it might be just another gimmick to stand out in a crowded market. But oh, how I was wrong. It’s not only functional but incredibly useful. Being able to simply open the app and instantly check the battery's charge level or its output/input without touching or turning on the power bank is a game-changer. Honestly, major brands like Apple should take a page from Anker's book and consider integrating this feature into products like AirPods.Speaking of the app, the graphics are top-notch. Everything is clear, concise, and user-friendly. Pairing and setup? A breeze. Within minutes, I was up and running, getting all the insights I needed about the power bank's performance.However, it wasn't all roses. Although the power bank promises high input rates by utilizing two ports simultaneously, my tests didn't quite match up to those claims. I used several 100W+ chargers but only managed to achieve a maximum input power rate of about 165W. While this is still impressive, it's worth noting for those looking to push the power bank to its limits.In conclusion, the Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank offers stellar build quality, innovative features, and mostly lives up to its performance promises. While there's room for improvement in power input, the overall experience more than compensates for it. Highly recommended for those seeking a reliable and high-tech charging solution.",5.0,2023-09-18,United Kingdom

R150YQNPD8820Z,"This sits up there with the controllers you get with a PS5 or an Xbox and feels weighty in the hand and has a decent tactile feel on its buttons. It is not as good as the dual sense (PS5) , but neither is the Xbox controller. The buttons (A,B,X,Y) are decent and have good push back, the triggers are firm and have a good resistance, the middle buttons (Select etc) are not quite as nicer feel in the hand but i do like the way the middle (Connect or LUNA button) is fully integrated into the controller and does not stand out, im not really a fan of this on the new Xbox Series controller and like the older iteration in the Xbox One. I also like the way the joysticks feel, they are not too loose and have a good rubber, at least currently. There is a textured plastic on the grips which is nice but not quite as good as the new Xbox Series controller.If you already have a controller on the other two platforms it may not be worth getting this but where the LUNA controller comes into its own is the connectivity - it truly feels seamless (From my MacBook to my iPad and then to my FireStick. It comes up with a pop up saying its playing via cloud and just works - almost reminiscent of apple products. It doesn’t replace other controllers but may sit in your portfolio if you are serious about gaming or experiencing what the developers want you to on the platform. As a note the bluetooth works well with the other controllers but you have top connect each time if you move where you are playing, a minor annoyance which may be worth noting.From me the latency is quite important and this feel extremely responsive, i have tried this with an average or 145mb/s internet and 20-40mb/s and they both work well. There was a few pop ups about the internet on the slower and not as constant internet but it didn’t stop me playing.For me this has found a place in my bag, as i travel often, as it works well and i have faith in the service - not to mention that there is quite a large launch library and 4 free games per month, what streaming service gives you that for simply being a member?I recommend this controller but do not expect it to be better than your premium console controller. If you want to get into cloud gaming this is a very good start (Better than the stadia controller, but lets not get into that catastrophe or a platform), if you care about ease, connectivity and simply working this works well!",5.0,2023-04-13,United Kingdom
R1LAM4Q4B1SGF,"If you have prime, you get 5 free games a month on Amazon Luna Subscription or pay 9.99 and get a larger selection plus also stream a majority of Ubisoft games that you may own. By far the best quality and reliability streaming service of which there are not many around.The controller itself is a good size and fairly comfortable with excellent grips, doesnt slide in the hands like xbox or ps. It is easy to put into bluetooth pairing mode and works well but the trick up its sleeve is the awesome inbuilt wifi receiver, its game changing! The amazon luna service is available as an app or web page on pretty much any device, if it can stream the web page the controller automatically connects to it once turned on its brilliant. On your PC, on your tablet, on your TV, on your Tesla.Tesla made it awkward to connect a controller to its newer cars until bluetooth support becomes available, but stream Amazon Luna on the web browser in the car and fire up the controller and away you go!Cons: Only few gripes are buttons are a bit firm to press, at the moment there is no replacement battery charger pack (just use a AA battery plug in charger) and the price. Its not cheap but to be fair its like two controllers in one, you may never need anything else and the technology is unique and just works out the box and you can wait for an Amazon sale. One controller I ordered did not work correctly but another positive of this Amazon controller is the usual Amazon service applies meaning replacement sent out asap 👌",5.0,2023-07-09,United Kingdom
R1CADSGEQVVDNR,"Firstly, the controller itself works perfectly with regular PC games, it's easy to connect to your PC and it works well.Ergonomically, the controller is comfortble to grip, and it feels like a premium X-Box controller (better quality than X-Box controllers)I think it is overpriced however. £60 is retal price for a proper PS5 Dualsense controller.The ""LUNA"" gaming service is pretty rubbish too, there aren't many games worth playing. Lego Fortnite is probably the only game on LUNA anyone has ever heard of.The games are very laggy, the resolution quality is poor, the audio quality is poor, and the controller continually disconnects from the service.Overall this is a great controller to use for regular PC gaming, but I don't recommend the Amazon ""LUNA"" cloud gaming service, purely because of the lack of ""good"" games and the constant connection issues.",4.0,2024-01-15,United Kingdom

R18YHV3H0MSZR6,"Firstly this is a Luna controller so it’s primarily used to play games on Luna over WiFi, however you can also connect to a PC to use as a wired controller, and if you install a Windows driver on your PC you can also use it over Bluetooth so it’s very versatile.This isn’t a review for the Luna platform so I won’t spend too much time on this, but with Prime you get some free games to play each month which is really good value (and you don’t necessarily need to have the controller to do so, but worth picking up if you do play regularly, especially if the controller is on sale).The controller itself feels solid, well built and the buttons feel clicky in all the right places. It feels comfortable in the hand, not too dissimilar to an Xbox controller. In fact if you’re used to using an Xbox controller then the button placement (A B X Y) and thumbsticks placement (asymmetrical) will feel very familiar as it’s the same with the Luna controller.Once you’ve done the original setup, connecting to Luna is a breeze and really easy to switch from screen to screen - you can stop playing on phone, pick it up on PC, then switch to TV (with a fire stick) which is such an amazing experience, and something only Google Stadia (RIP) could do otherwise.TLDR: pick up this controller, you won’t regret it.",5.0,2023-12-26,United Kingdom
R32PZ2OEU5ZPNS,"The controller is 'fine' in terms of build quality, not great but not bad. Other reviews saying this is on par with the latest Xbox pads are wide of the mark and people comparing with the Dualsense have no idea what they are talking about; the controller is nothing like the standard you get with any of the latest gen consoles. The buttons are reasonably tactile and the finish on the surface is just ok.There is no built in lithium battery and there is no option to purchase one, like a play and charge kit for example. You are forced into using AA batteries (which are provided and do seem to last a long time).The controller cannot be used over Bluetooth with Apple devices, tried an Apple TV and an iPad pro, can't comment on Android as I haven't tried. Why you would connect it via Bluetooth to any other device I can not understand, so Bluetooth connectivity is NOT a selling feature. I see no reason to connect it to my PC as I have an Xbox dongle with various controllers for that sole purpose. If I were using a competing cloud platform for example Geforce Now, then any controller would do the trick.The only real use case/USP for this device is with the actual Luna platform. The main selling feature for me, being reduced latency due to a WiFi connection.The logging in and setting up process was seamless and the connection is very stable but the difference in latency is not massive, contrary to what various YouTube videos led me to believe. It feels a little more responsive than Bluetooth controllers but certainly nothing to write home about (I am on 900mb full fibre).The biggest issue is the limited places I can use this controller. If Luna was an amazing service and I used it all the time then I could say confidently this is the best way to access it... But unfortunately that isn't the case.The platform is very poor with clunky integrations with some second-rate PC store fronts (GOG and Ubisoft). Constantly being bombarded with adverts to 'upgrade' to some extra tier with extra benefits. Most of the Ubisoft games I own don't even show up as playable which seems odd to say the least but that's kind of how Ubisoft is these days (unreliable and kind of rubbish). Monthly Prime Games are literally like 20 year old PC titles that I've either already played or have no interest in. The only other game worthy of playing as of right now is Fortnite but a competitive shooter over the cloud against a load of twitchy-fingered 12-year olds playing at 120 fps on PC/PS5? No thanks.I haven't actually picked the controller up in a few weeks because there aren't any games I want to play on this service and if I want to play Fortnite, I want to play it properly (and natively).Perhaps if Epic went all in with Amazon and allowed you to access your Epic library through Luna, this may become a worthwhile purchase.For now though, it's so heavily reliant on the quality of the Luna offering, and this falls well short, the controller feels like a bit of a waste of money.",2.0,2024-12-31,United Kingdom

Nomatter which device I open luna on all I need to do is turn the controller on & it connects. Bluetooth requires you to have bluetooth enabled on whatever device you're using & lastly you can just plug the controller in with the usb cable. The cable that comes with it is for that purpose, it's not a charging cable, it does power the controller though so you can still game if your batteries are flat.You need two AA batteries, if you use rechargeables you cannot charge them while they are in the controller.

It's pretty portable so would be a good makeshift games console for those on the move a lot.Cons:The device that you play this on heavily dictates the enjoyment and playability, the difference between using a latest Ipad to a Fire Stick can be vast, so it's worth bearing that in mind.Also, the subscription to pay more than the 5 games that comes with a Prime subscription can be quite steep.

RIG3ZADYE5G1U,"It's difficult to review the luna controller without reviewing the Luna streaming service.The controller is well built, the buttons though very 'clicky' compared to say it's most obvious relation the Xbox controller and I doubt there is very much if any analogue feature to them such as a soft press.However it works well, the analogue sticks are good and responsive and there are plenty of set up options.  It has to be said that it takes 2 AA batteries and as yet there are no available charging packs with dock available and the USB C connection doesn't charge rechargables if fitted.  Controller though does work with PC directly coupled by the USB C cable but also has wireless and bluetooth connectivity.When using as a bluetooth controller (I tried with gamepass) it is Ok and works well but I would still choose a PS or XBOX controller.When it comes to using it with the Luna service you see the benefit of the wireless control.  You can pair the bluetooth to any device but have to repair when moving, with the wireless - you can use any device be it tablet with Luna App or PC with browser or even the Fire Stick and as long as they are on the same network the device will be synced to your luna controller which takes the effort out of pairing and makes it truly multiplatform.  On the Luna app with Fortnite it had little to no lag and was great to use, some other games did take a bit of tinkering to play well as they are PC versions but overall a really good experience.  What lets it all down is the games available on Luna, there simply are not enough of interest to make the subscription worthwhile and if you want Ubisoft on top thats another £12 a month.So overall a decent controller which works really well with Luna streaming service.  Luna service is more reliable and plays better for me than the Gamepass online bus simply doesn't have the support in games to make it worthwhile yet.",2.0,2023-07-03,United Kingdom

I don't want to push limits of games, just play smoothly and it does that fine for me.The controller is one of the common button layouts and feels solid.

RBTXH1RS52DTV,"Controller feels good quality and is responsive when playing. The Luna service itself has a good offering of games although I feel that they need to work on adding more titles to the Luna+ subscription to keep subscribers.There’s monthly games with Prime that don’t require the Luna+ subscription though those alone may not be enough to make people shell out for the controller (and are games included in the Luna+ sub already). There’s a few good well known titles on the subscription such as Control, Alien Isolation and some older Capcom games - though the service did just lose Resident Evil 2 and 3. There’s also a good selection of games from lesser known studios, such as Tormented Souls, Dusk and a number of others.",5.0,2023-06-09,United Kingdom

If you stick with Bluetooth connection you can use the controller to control the Fire TV Stick/ Cube and the Luna app, so why use the Wi Fi connection for the marginal at best improvement to latency. Personally, whilst the Wi-Fi Direct connection is a great idea, it’s hobbled (again), I’d prefer use Bluetooth mode for convenience.My other frustration is with Bluetooth controller implementation on Amazon TV products. if you want to use other game streaming services, think again! Amazon use their own button layout (non XInput) so if you want to use GeForce Now, XBox Game Pass, Boosteroid etc, for some inexplicable reason the menu (hamburger) button, whilst looks the same on every controller known to man, operates differently on Fire products. Why? It’s just completely unnecessary.. get a Nvidia Shield instead for maximum compatibility.After saying all of this the controller does actually feel great in the hand and if you are looking for a quality Bluetooth controller this competes with the others around this price point.",2.0,2023-03-24,United Kingdom

The sleek design, sturdy build, and clear instructions made installation a breeze.Performance-wise, this inverter is a powerhouse. It effortlessly converts DC power to AC, providing a stable and reliable power source for all my needs. Whether it's running my refrigerator, power tools, or charging my devices, the Renogy 2000W handles everything with ease. The pure sine wave output is perfect for sensitive electronics, and I've noticed no interference or noise whatsoever.One of the standout features is its efficiency. It operates so quietly and smoothly that I sometimes forget it’s even running. The advanced safety features give me peace of mind, knowing that my equipment is protected against overloads and overheating.Customer service from Renogy has been top-notch as well. They were incredibly responsive to my queries and provided excellent support throughout the setup process.If you're looking for a reliable, efficient, and high-performance inverter, look no further than the Renogy 2000W.

R13F1WEEY0BV5M,"EditHaving had issues with the Renogy inverter (see below) I now have it functioning correctly.For the initial installation I used the cables supplied with the unit.Renogy contacted me due to my poor review. I was told my system was not up to the power requirements, my battery was insufficient or my induction stove was pulling a surge current tripping the unit out.Following advice from a 3rd party I replaced the cables supplied with a 50mm2 alternative on both +ve and -ve terminals. It now operates my induction hob at 1900watts without issue.So, as long as you use higher quality cable than those supplied it seems a good inverter. I wish the same could be said for Renogy’s customer service.I have increased the score initially given to reflect my updated experience with this unit.Original review:-“Good looking sturdy unit which was straightforward to install.Performance with my portable induction hob was less than satisfactory.I tried it with a ring at full power (1900watts) and it tripped out after a few seconds.I reduced the power level in stages until it would continue to run. That was at 1450watts.Pretty disappointing for a unit rated at 2000watts continuous.Cannot recommend to others. If I hadn’t disposed of the packaging it would be going back.Shame really as the Renogy DC-DC charger with MPPT I bought to run alongside the inverter is really good.”",4.0,2021-08-13,United Kingdom
R3EEQXI3NI7DNQ,"I purchased this inverter to go with my small solar setup.  Having recently invested in a LIFEPO4 battery i needed something to power our Projector.  There are a ton of inverter out there, one thing i knew i wanted was a pure sine wave inverter from a reputable brand.  My projector is worth £3500 and i did not want to blow it up with a cheap inverter!Having read a ton of reviews and watched lots of social media videos i decided this Renogy 1000w fitted my requirements.The device itself is huge!  Much bigger than i expected.  It feels substantial - and the build quality is excellent.  Wiring up the inverter to the battery was a 2 minute job using the included cables.  You also get a wired remote with the inverter, but i decided not to use this.  The inverter has one 3 pin UK plug socket on the front.  I connected up my projector and powered it on - it worked great!What i really love about this inverter is that it is totally silent!  My projector on ECO modes draws around 170w, and clearly the inverter is comfortable with this load without ramping up the internal fan.  We have a smaller 500w inverter which we use to power other small device, but this thing is noisy!!! So it was great that the Renogy was silent.  We use the inverter for around 4-5hrs a night, and yes it is reasonably warm after this time, but nothing that would concern me.  The device is fully fused and has good safety features.  I had zero concerns using this device.  I have not pushed it anywhere near it's limits, and too be honest do not intend too as i purchased this solely for my projector.Overall i am super impressed with this inverter and would not hesitate to recommend it to others!",5.0,2023-02-07,United Kingdom
RCP297YL44LD6,"Works great, laughs at any load, the remote control has a simple pinout so you can tap into it to remotely turn on or off if you want (and I have extended my remote cable with a plain male-female Cat6 cable extender, about 10m, but watch that it's wired straight pin-to-pin).Silent below about 100W draw, then ramps up fans over that depending on the load.  Seems pretty bulletproof.Only unfortunate thing is that you can't silence the low battery alarm, and it can be quite piercing, but it's an alarm for a reason.  Would be nice if either a) that audible alarm has extended into the remote unit so you could hear it where you need to, but all you get is a tiny LED, or b) you could silence the alarm so that the inverter isn't beeping all night because the battery bank got drained overnight.Be aware that, like a lot of inverters, you can still get a nasty shock from the battery *INPUT* lugs even after it's been switched off.  Don't just assume that because it's an input it won't come back out and get you from the internal capacitors.",5.0,2023-09-14,United Kingdom
R2XVUSL2BTZU2F,Received this yesterday and was surprised at the cables . This is a 2000W inverter with a 4000W peak yet the cables are 4AWG . they are also quite short . This also needs a 250 amp fuse . So unless you already have your own cables and fuse and holder be prepared to spend another £50 or so to make this a safe product to use . After contacting Renogy  their response was they try to keep costs down to make it affordable . Personally I would like to pay a bit more and have a product that is up to the job and is safe . I have asked if I can buy better cables from them but they don’t sell them .To be fair it was packaged well and seems to be well built .

This by the way is for in my motorhome,  so far its run a modern nespresso machine, 2  colour TV... just small ones, compressor fridge, and I've even had the water boiler on with it, there is 2 temp settings on the water heater, 40 and 60, it did the 40 without breaking a sweat, but the 60 really hammered my lithium batteries x2 100a Also Renogy... they started off on 100% and by the time the water had finished they were down to 46%...I am new to lithium and have only just installed them but this inverter is without a shadow of doubt the Boss.. not cut out or bleeped or gone into overload protection or anything..very pleased with it and highly recommend it.I only opted to buy it via amazon because of their excellent customer service returns policy  I could have got it £30 cheaper from the supplier off their website but then you have the hassle of returning it if anything is wrong, whereas amazon arrange a collection from your door next day..Inverter 10/10  and 5*Update: I have had this now while on tour around Europe with all the standard fittings that came with the inverter itself and can say with honesty i have not had a single issue with it - i have an induction hob connected on 2000w an Air Conditioner running 800w and also a Nespresso coffee machine all running together, the cables never felt warm or even tepid, and what is surprising to me to date is i have not once ever heard the fans come on - the inverter i purchased before this Renogy system - which was also a 3000w - The fan used to come on as soon as you turned something on, then within 30 seconds would beep and shut down - so on my personnel experience i still stand by the 5 stars i gave it - and in fact i have purchased another but via Renogy web site, at the time it was on offer at nearly £40 less than Amazon plus i got 5% off nearly £15 for a voucher - i personally cannot fault it !",5.0,2021-08-10,United Kingdom

R3MDE75PJP2AI2,"This is only based on first tests of the inverter. But there is definitely room for improvement. The socket seems mechanically not up to standards. Inserting plugs is very fiddly. I tried various plugs and it takes on all of them quite some bit of wriggling to get the ground pin past the child safety.The quiescent current on the DC side is shown as 0.6A. This is quite a house number. Multiplied by the the 13V from the battery that is 7.8W for doing nothing usable. You better do not forget to switch the inverter off.Other than those initial niggles the inverter has been behaving as one would expect. I still gave a full rating as high quiescent currents are unfortunately pretty common on such inverters, despite there being existing circuitry for micro inverters which can do a lot better. Less than 1W is perfectly doable. At those 7.8W you would have drained a fully charged 200Ah battery in just over 12 days on standby.But I will keep my eye on developments and revise my review once the inverter will get used more. I do not plan to plug and unplug frequently, hence I just accept it as it is for now.",5.0,2022-02-15,United Kingdom

Don't buy a dodgy unknown rip off, it will last 6 months a pop. The 1000w will power most  domestic 240v products if using one item at a time if it draws a fair bit. However don't make the mistake i made as i wanted to power a 700w microwave. Be careful as 700w is the cooking power not the consumption power. The microwave will consume 1200w approx so if you intend to briefly power a microwave now and again you will need to upgrade to the 2000w machine. Love the mains power lead too. This means if you plug into hook up it will act as an extension lead and you don't have to swap plug sockets. Customer service was good too when i did upgrade. All ill buy from now on is renogy.

This unit really feels well made and up for the task, and doesnt suffer from the annoyances you get with the cheaper non-branded units.The battery terminals are spot on and feel really secure, you dont have to deal with irritating beebs on high surge loads, and the added automatic transfer swith is amazing and really needs to be a more common option on the smaller units (1-2kw inverters).It happily runs a medium/large fridge freezer, microwave and a coffee machine (not at the same time) with no issues, and has even ran my house completely off grid for several hours. It's pretty quiet too!An added bonus i found is that the included remote uses a standard ethernet network terminal. It comes with a generous amount of wire, but is also able to utilize a female to female ethernet coupler, allowing you to increase the legnth significantly, really usefull!I may have finnaly found a brand i can trust when it comes to this type of equipment.Thank you Renogy, i'll be checking out your solar panels next!",5.0,2020-02-27,United Kingdom

The app itself is user-friendly, allowing me to manage devices remotely, set up automated schedules, and even use timers to control when devices turn on or off.The device-sharing feature is fantastic for my household, as it allows my family to control the plugs as well. I love the Away Mode, which is ideal for security when we’re out of the house, as it randomly turns devices on and off to give the impression that someone’s home. The voice control feature is a bonus, and it works perfectly with my Amazon Alexa, making it so convenient to control everything with simple voice commands.The 4-pack is great value, especially since I’ve used the plugs to control lights, fans, and other devices. The only downside I’ve noticed is that the plugs are a bit bulky, so they might block adjacent sockets if you're using a power strip. Overall, I’m really happy with these smart plugs and would recommend them for anyone looking to add some automation and convenience to their home.",5.0,2025-02-18,United Kingdom

I can either tell me Google assistant to turn it on on-demand or via a schedule. The plug is compact enough not to block adjacent sockets, which is a good feature.What I appreciate most is its reliability, I have had no issues so far with this so I wouldn’t say you need much technical knowledge to operate it.

R8RWANF3P6YJS,"To use the plugs, one must install the Topo app. It is only when one installs the app that one comes across its privacy policy, which is intrusive and impossible to accept. Following are highlights of the policy:TP-Link will collect information about the devices connected to the plugs (Point 2.3). They may collect IP address, location, mobile device information, user name, email address, shipping address, log-in and password details [!!], communications via phone calls, e-mail, social media, … the list is extensive and alarming (Point 4). Not only will TP-Link be allowed to use such information itself, it is also allowed to transfer such information to third parties (Point 5.2). Furthermore, customer information may be transferred to parties that may acquire TP-Link in the future (Point 5.4).One buys a wifi-enabled plug to connect to one’s devices to power supply remotely. It must be able to manufacture plugs that do just that without requiring an app to set up. More importantly, there is no reason for the plug to collect so much information from its customers. There is even less justification for them to pass our personal information to third parties. Whether or how they may be able to collect such information is secondary. I cannot grant them permission to do so.Therefore I intend to return the product.",1.0,2021-01-23,United Kingdom

They were easy enough to connect but bug me because Alexa doesn't always switch them on or off immediately when asked.Sometimes I have to wait up to 2 minutes before she does what I ask.It's a small thing but is irritating as she responds to the Amazon smart plug immediately. It's random with these, sometimes she does it straight away and sometimes it takes up to 2 minutes, hence 4 stars instead of 5.Just something to be aware of before you purchase these plugs.",4.0,2025-02-14,United Kingdom

R3BEQAUQFFIX5G,"I got the Tapo P100 Alexa smart plug thinking I’d be living in a sci-fi movie, barking commands at Alexa like a tech genius. The reality? Well, it’s been a bit of a journey. First off, I love that it doesn’t need a hub because, let’s be honest, I barely know what a hub is, and the fewer mystery gadgets around, the better. Alexa listens, though like a teenager, she does it on her own terms. I told her to turn off the lamp, and instead, my toaster stopped working. Why? No clue, but it was hilarious.The Tapo app lets me turn things on and off while I’m away from home, which is perfect for randomly turning on the living room lights while I’m at work just to freak out the cat. I also set the plug to turn off my coffee machine in the morning, which sounds genius, except for the time I was still pouring my first cup when everything suddenly shut down like the Matrix collapsed.Now, the downside: there’s no energy monitoring, so while it can help me turn off a forgotten fan, I still don’t know how much that fan is adding to my electric bill. Setup had its moments too — make sure you’re in the same room as the router! It took me a good 10 minutes of confusion before I realized my phone was connected to my neighbor’s Wi-Fi.Sharing control with the family is fun, but do so wisely. I gave my spouse access, and suddenly my lamp was blinking in Morse code at 3 a.m. when I was trying to sleep. Revenge? Probably.All in all, it’s a great little gadget. Just be sure your router, your phone, and maybe a few prayers are nearby during setup. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I trust it with my coffee machine again? Jury’s still out on that one.",5.0,2024-10-05,United Kingdom

R2KTA045R9IRMG,"I've been on the hunt for smart plugs that are both reliable and affordable, and the Tapo Smart Plug Wi-Fi Outlet 4-pack has exceeded my expectations in every way.Initially, I bought these smart plugs to solve a very specific problem: the nightly hassle of getting out of bed to turn off my salt lamp. As someone who loves to wind down by journaling or watching something cozy, the last thing I want to do is disrupt my relaxation by getting up. Enter Tapo Smart Plugs – my bedtime routine has never been smoother.I've been using these plugs for a month now, and the setup was a breeze. Simply follow the clear instructions on the app to pair each plug with your Wi-Fi, and you're ready to go. The user-friendly app allows you to control your devices from anywhere, whether you're snuggled up in bed or out running errands. I've tested it extensively, even when I’m far from home, and it works like a charm every time.The ""Away"" mode, which turns your devices on and off at random intervals to make it look like someone’s home, is a handy feature. You can also schedule your devices to turn on and off at specific times, perfect for automating your morning coffee routine or ensuring the lights are off when you leave the house. The timer option is another useful tool, allowing you to set a countdown for your devices.The app also provides insightful data on your usage patterns. The interface is sleek and intuitive, with a shortcut option to turn everything off with one tap. You can add shortcuts within the app or on your iPhone to switch off or on the smart plugs all at the same time, which is effective and adds a cool touch to my bedroom. While the plugs are compatible with Alexa and Google Home, I've been using Siri shortcuts on my iPhone. It's a slightly longer setup process, but worth it for voice control, though it can be a bit temperamental.A quirky yet satisfying detail is the subtle click sound the plugs make when switching on or off – a small touch that adds to the overall smart home experience. The versatility of these smart plugs is impressive; anything you can plug in, you can now control remotely. Plus, they make for a cool little party trick. My friends are always amazed when I control the lights with my phone, thinking I have some sort of magical power!Compared to other smart plugs on the market, the value for money with this 4-pack is unbeatable. Whether you're looking to automate a single lamp or your entire home, these smart plugs are the way to go. I can't recommend them enough!With these smart plugs, the possibilities are truly endless.

You download the app, create a login using your email address and a password (which doesn't need to have 9million characters and six different categories of characters!!).

Means if you use a 4 gang extension lead only two sockets can be fitted!They connect almost instantly to the Tapo app but one socket did require a long 5 second press to engage the pairing mode.Not sure if it was previously returned and sent out as new on my order having not been flashed in the refurb department.I don't buy refurbished, I buy new but it doesn't stop Amazon pulling a fast one on Prime Day.If you buy the Tapo Hub to work with the infrared sensor expect the Hub to disconnect the whole WiFi throughout your home at random.Even with the firmware update it still misbehaves but once it's unplugged from its socket, everything is back online instantly.It's a flawed concept to suggest WiFi apps and gadgets work for the disabled via voice control.It may sound good but unless you are a computer programmer like me, you will be massively disappointed because a lot of it is tat, like the Philips Hue system and it costs considerably more.If your mobility isn't an issue then maybe this problematic system is to your liking.Just don't rely upon these on equipment that your life depends on a permanent connection like a CPAP machine.Always check the current requirements of your device before using these as they may catch fire when, they create an open circuit bypassing your breaker switch in the consumer board.I tested mine for resistance before my daughter plugged them in.Living alone means I have to be extra careful because my daughter doesn't want to walk in on a very crisply-burnt father!",3.0,2024-07-21,United Kingdom

R29ZBCJ4KEVG15,"I've got three Kasa sockets set up and I had no problems with them.  Unfortunately, I got confused and thought I was buying more of the same.  I spend £28 on a box of four.  None of them can be found (""We couldn't find this Tapo device"") and I'm following all the instructions on resetting and bluetooth and all that.So, I reckon I'll box them back up and ask my friends if they want to try them.  Else, they are going back.Changed my mind.  13.01.2022Why?  Well, eventually the app worked and found the new Tapo plugs.  Now, also, I have realised something significantly difference between these Tapo plugs and their Kasa equivalents.  When power is restored to them, either after the consumer unit/fusebox has been off or the switch on the socket has been off, they can be programmed to come back online without actually turning on.The device settings, for the Kasa KP105s that I have, is minimal, with LED status (whether the LEDs stay on or not) and name/icon.  Turn the power back on - the devices plugged into Kasa adapters come on.The device settings, for the Tapo P100s, have a default state option which includes 'off'.This may not seem like a big deal but if, like me, you're on economy seven and your mystery phantom load is doing your head in - you may like to just switch everything off at the consumer unit during peak rate times.  It can make a difference of £1 a day in electricity bills.  With the Kasa adapters - everything turns on and the energy use goes way up until one is able to get on the apps and turn everything off again.  Tapo have the default 'off' state option, though.  This is good.  I might get more.  I'm sorry I didn't see this earlier and that I didn't come back when the Tapo app noticed my new adapters because they are, in turns out, very efficient for my needs.Now, I have other Tapo and Kasa devices.  The bulbs all work fine.  It might not be TP Links fault that these sockets don't work in my setup.  There may be some small print I have missed.  What IS TP Link's fault is that they are running, side by side, Tapo AND Kasa instead of merging their two varieties.  I can't easily tell the differences.  There seem to be some things the Tapo bulbs can do, that the Kasa can't, and vice versa.  Why not just make one range?  Then we won't be accidentally buying things designed to not work alongside what we already have.The bulbs, on the other hand, are a completely inverted situation.  Kasa BULBS can get set to come on, after a power outage, in the off condition.  Tapo bulbs can only come on as either the previous on setting or as a predefined colour/brightness.So, if I was starting out with the automation all over again, I'd have Kasa bulbs and Tapo plug adapters.  I think that's the right way round...",5.0,2021-11-23,United Kingdom

However, my concerns regarding the product and company practices remain.My Orthopedic Surgeon and Physiotherapist both expressed skepticism about the product's claims and even showed me these Akusoli insoles they’d ordered from Amazon. As I mentioned I was waiting on an order.The insoles significantly underdeliver on their advertised benefits:No Magnetic Pain Relief: The purported magnets exhibit no magnetic properties. Furthermore, the metal inclusions feel like pebbles within the shoe, causing considerable discomfort.Lack of ""Instant Comfort Boost"": The insoles are cheaply constructed, a fact apparent upon initial inspection.False ""Massaging Foot Support"" Claim: This advertised feature is entirely inaccurate.Despite ordering in November, I have yet to receive my order. However, the samples I tried proved to be unwearable due to the aforementioned issues.Furthermore, I am deeply concerned by Akusoli's aggressive marketing tactics.The auto-payment setup was activated without my consent at the time of purchase.Additionally, they have been sending unsolicited spam emails to an email address I never provided or subscribed to, with no ""Unsubscribe"" option – a clear breach of EU GDPR regulations, which mandate explicit consent for marketing emails and the availability of an ""Unsubscribe"" link.

I refused to believe it at first because it's just so unbelievably ridiculous but I am now 100% sure it's the bulbs.If you have a ""Risco"" alarm with wireless sensors, you should probably avoid these bulbs!Otherwise, they're actually a great product and super easy to set up lolGood colours and functionality.

RHWO2YL44W25E,I purchased these after alot of thought about if I wanted to start automating the house. These bulbs were my first smart purchase as I already had Alexa devices to use to control them. I was pleasantly surprised! I purchased these just before Christmas 2024 and after a fairly easy setup (don't be put off if they don't connect to your setup first time just try again with your phone closer and they will connect and work perfectly after that) spent the next hour trying out all the different colours and light levels and I was very pleased. The cost was not too expensive to buy as a decent LED bulb is almost the same cost anyway. They are well made and don't feel like they are going to break putting them in the sockets.After using these I purchased 2 more to use elsewhere in the house and now I have bulbs and smart sockets all round the house all made by Tapo.I would highly recommend the Tapo brand as I have had zero issues with anything I have bought so far.,5.0,2025-02-16,United Kingdom

R2QFNXT76S33FH,"The set-up for this is quite complicated for an IT novice.Thankfully I am not.But..It regularly loses the router connection even though other connected devices show a strong signal.In order to maintain control of the device, you have to turn it on and off via the application.This is absolutely not practical.People are turning lights on and off at the wall.The control app is unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't do anything, even though it shows as connected.The lowest light intensity setting is too high.On the bright side (intended..) it does display very vivid colours and the pre-set themes are OK.My daughter likes the light in her room.As a basic light, without colours, it is actually OK. Once you set the intensity, warmth and colour, it always comes on with that setting.If i were to purchase such an item again, I may go for a more expensive, well established brand.",4.0,2025-01-05,United Kingdom
R3OC62GPDAS0Y,"Been using these for a couple days now. I have them linked to the Tapo app and Home Assistant (I'm still very knew to Home Assistant and the whole ""smart home"" thing)It works great but both bulbs I ordered have randomly disconnected on me, ONCE (so far). When this happened and when I turned them on, it would flash the lights as if the bulb was still in setup mode, so when this happened I needed to connect to their Wi-Fi hotspot and re-link them to the app and everything. (Home assistant automatically picked them up and re-linked them though so that's great)I also tested them, and they work without internet so that's great! However you will still probably need an internet connection to actually link them to the Tapo app because you will need to make an account, so that means if the company goes bankrupt and purge all their servers, if a bulb goes offline then you probably won't be able to re-configure them, idk tbh.If you're buying these lights, you should probably invest in their Tapo smart switches (or any smart switch for that matter). Remember, not all smart switches will work, you will probably need to find a DECOUPLED smart switch that does NOT cut off the power to the actual bulb. And then you will need to make an automation of sorts yourself. (The Tapo smart switches have a decoupled mode so you could just buy those I guess, but do your own research as well)Oh side note; If you're like me and want to set colours via RGB or hex codes, you cannot do that via the Tapo app, which is a huge disappointment. Also, party mode doesn't exist in the Tapo app anymore (?)Not to worry though. You can do all that with Home Assistant so I would recommend you set that up as well if you're serious about getting these bulbs all around your house.",4.0,2024-10-19,United Kingdom

I have multiple all around the house, and have even gifted them to family.The bulbs are smart so you’ll need to download the app on your phone — which essentially turns your phone into a remote control that control the on-off function of the bulbs and their colour and intensity.No more feeling the walls in the dark in hope of finding that light switch to turn on the lights; no more getting out of bed because I forgot to turn a light off. I can now just turn any light on and off at home from my mobile phone — I can do this from the comfort of my own bed, or from the comfort of a bed in a hotel on the other side of the world.The app is great — easy to use and intuitive. And although I’ve only use the colour function to change the colour of the light during Halloween, it’s a great function to have just in case you need it.

Its easy setup, convenient control options, and compatibility with voice assistants make it a versatile addition to any smart home ecosystem. With energy-efficient LED technology, it not only enhances your lighting experience but also helps you save on energy costs.Please note that this review is based on the provided information, and personal experiences with the product may vary.Please note before buying,The TP-Link Kasa app and the Tapo app are two different applications developed by TP-Link for controlling their respective smart home devices. Here's a comparison of the two:1. Device Compatibility: The Kasa app is designed for managing TP-Link smart home devices such as smart plugs, smart switches, and smart bulbs. It supports a wider range of TP-Link devices compared to the Tapo app, which is specifically tailored for Tapo series devices like smart bulbs, smart plugs, and security cameras.2. User Interface and Features: Both apps offer user-friendly interfaces with intuitive controls. The Kasa app provides a more extensive range of features and customization options due to its compatibility with various TP-Link devices. It includes advanced settings, energy monitoring, scene creation, and scheduling capabilities. On the other hand, the Tapo app focuses on simplicity and ease of use, offering essential controls for Tapo devices, including scheduling, remote access, and motion detection settings for cameras.3. Integration and Ecosystem: The Kasa app has broader integration capabilities, supporting popular voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. It can also integrate with other smart home ecosystems like Amazon Echo and Google Home, providing seamless control and automation. The Tapo app, while limited in terms of third-party integrations, still offers voice control compatibility with Amazon Alexa for Tapo devices.4. Target Audience and Device Focus: The Kasa app caters to a wider range of TP-Link smart home devices, making it suitable for users with a diverse set of devices within their smart home ecosystem. The Tapo app, on the other hand, is specifically designed for users who primarily own Tapo series devices, providing a more focused and streamlined experience for those particular products.Ultimately, the choice between the Kasa app and the Tapo app depends on the TP-Link devices you own and your specific needs. If you have a mix of TP-Link smart home devices, the Kasa app may offer a more comprehensive control and customization experience. However, if you primarily use Tapo series devices, the Tapo app provides a dedicated and simplified interface tailored specifically for those products.",5.0,2023-05-27,United Kingdom

RBC7N1HW23JSA,"Plenty bright for a reasonably sized room when using white light. My rooms are 4x5 yards and I find that a brightness setting 25% is comfortable for most tasks. According to my smart meter this only uses a couple of watts.Set up was easy. One the account was created the Tapo app talks you through the process complete with diagrams. I did have a problem initialising one of the bulbs which it refused to add to the virtual network. Reading the troubleshooting guide the app presented told me that I shouldn't be running a VPN while initialising the bulb. Turned it off and hey presto. The VPN doesn't affect interacting with the bulb after it has been initialised and added to your home network.Timers and schedules are stored on the bulb, so you don't have to have an active network or mobile device available once these are set up.You can easily configure what the bulb does when it is switched on. It can use the same colour and brightness setting it was using when it was switched off or it can default to any colour and brightness you specify. Means that you don't have to fiddle around with a device when you turn it on at the wall.There are some weaknesses. The themes, which let you have the bulb changing colour continuously, aren't great. They either switch directly from one colour to another or fade towards black, change colour and brighten again. Missing is an option to move smoothly through the colour spectrum from one colour to the next - even my dumb 16 colour bulb with a remote control can do that, so it's strange this can't. It also doesn't seem to be possible to set a theme as the default on setting which means you can't use a schedule to have the bulb switch on running a theme. The gradual on/off setting isn't gradual enough - it takes under a second. It would be nice if you could set how long it takes to go from off to your desired brightness and vice versa. One can only hope that a future software update may correct some of these weaknesses.",4.0,2023-12-05,United Kingdom

R1V9Z0KY2VP2PL,"I bought this, after buying another TAPO product recently, and because I had the app on my phone and ally information was already stored, it took seconds to set up.Just in case this is your first one, here are some tips I learned the hard way the first time I set a TAPO device up.....1: do not plug it in until you have the app installed and open and ready to add a device.2. The very first thing you need to do is download and install the app, then follow the instructions to set up an account, then follow the instructions to set up a device...3: when it says "" turn on location"" as an optional choice, Turn on location, it will not pair of location is off, now you might always have your location switched on, in which case this will not bother you, but if like me you are not constantly broadcasting your location, it is a must. After much to and fro with the support team, I figured this out, not them, so I asked them to either fix the back end or make location a must not an optional setting.3: you will need to know, before you start, your network password, your Google/ Alexa password of you are linking it.Note: if you already have a device set up And you selected "" remember my network password"" the first time, for every new device you don't have to go hunting down your network/ braodband password, which is great.Also the second device just paired with Google and Alexa without any input from me, which is also great ( for me Google home picked up the second device before Alexa, and spoke to me through my Google speaker to let me know it was connected, and then Alexa chimed in to say they were also connected to the new device )4: you need to go to your internet settings on your phone/ computer, whichever device you are using the TAPO app on,  and select the TAPO network when it tells you to, not to worry it doesn't switch off your connection to your own router, anyone who has set up similar devices will know this, but the app does hint at this but doesn't make it clear so I mentioned it here.The light has two main buttons, white or colour, the white, is as standard that harsh white light, however, the tutorial shows you how to set up custom colours that it remembers so I fiddled with the really user friendly colour wheel until I got a warm white shade I liked, and that was it, now it stays on that, unless I chose another colour, but even then my custom colour( or colours as you can set up lots) stay stored with an icon showing you the colour you chose, so it is never more than a clock away.The integration with Google home and Alexa ( I have both, because, you know different things for different purposes) is seamless, once you popped your password in and confirmed once, the next device just connects without bother, so if you are replacing all your bulbs you don't have to do a big begging set up for each one.Each bulb or other tapi device is shown in the app, and you can tell the app where they are, so that you can easily turn them on individually, change colours individually, change brightness individually, and control them with voice controls if you have a voice input Google ( Google home & compatible device like speakers or your android phones voice through Google assistant, Alexa echo or other Alexa voice control like an app on your phone)Therefore you can exit the house saying turn off the lights and keep the pitch light on, or also say "" turn off the lights in little Jimmy's room , like if you want them to go to bed""",5.0,2022-12-15,United Kingdom
R34AN0SL6H93SX,"For this price band, it is extremely good. Very easy to install, especially if you are already a Tapo user/customer. You can literally connect it with your Tapo app, and start enjoying making the most out of the smart features. You can create automation using the bulbs and your camera. Colours are all very nice. It could be a lot better tho. The brightness can be a little bit better. It can flicker when it is on low brightness levels. I think the most annoying part is the limitations on colour selection. It works wonders with the preset colour options and I'm sure it supports millions of colours but the section in the app you can change the colour is almost impossible to use. I wish the app was allowing us to use HEX or RGB codes to pick a colour. Overall for this price, it's lovely. Buy a Tapo camera and some LED stripes. You and your neighbours will be impressed.

As someone who is always looking for ways to make my home more efficient and convenient, this smart bulb has been a game changer.First of all, the installation process was incredibly easy. All I had to do was screw in the bulb, download the Tapo app, and connect the bulb to my WiFi network. It took less than 5 minutes and I was able to control the bulb with my phone right away.One of the best features of this smart bulb is the ability to change the color and brightness. I love being able to adjust the lighting to fit my mood or the occasion. The range of colors is impressive and the brightness can go from dim to very bright, making it perfect for any setting.The Tapo app also allows for scheduling and automation. I can set the bulb to turn on and off at certain times, which is great for when I am away from home. I can also create scenes and routines, so the bulb turns on and off in a certain pattern. This has been especially helpful in creating a relaxing and cozy atmosphere in my bedroom.One of the biggest advantages of having a WiFi smart bulb is the ability to control it from anywhere. I no longer have to get out of bed to turn off the lights, I can just use my phone. This has also been helpful when I forget to turn off the lights after leaving the house, I can simply do it remotely.The Tapo Smart Bulb is also compatible with voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, which is a great added convenience. I can now control the lights with just my voice, making it even easier to use.Overall, I highly recommend the Tapo Smart Bulb for anyone looking to make their home smarter and more efficient.

R1IFXYB0YNGGPJ,"I bought 4 L530e bulbs for my new outdoor garden wall lights.

Once set up it was an easy task to go into the Alexa app, find the smart bulb and link the Alexa app and Tapo app to give full voice control.It has many colour settings, plus a couple of preprogrammed settings including a party mode if you want multi colours flashing lights, not really for me though.It’s fully dimmable, either via the app or Alexa voice control: just say “Alexa, smart bulb to 20%” and just like that it becomes 20% or whatever percentage of light you want. At full brightness this bulb gives out plenty of light, and you can adjust the colour to suit your mood or if you have light sensitive eyes.Over all I’m really impressed with this, and as I said I’m glad I decided to go down this route.",5.0,2024-02-03,United Kingdom

This smart bulb is a game-changer in terms of convenience and energy efficiency.One of the standout features of this smart bulb is its compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, allowing for seamless integration into a smart home ecosystem. With simple voice commands, I can easily control the brightness and color of the bulb, creating the perfect ambiance for any occasion.Setting up the Tapo Smart Bulb was a breeze, as it requires no hub for operation. I simply downloaded the Tapo app, connected the bulb to my Wi-Fi network, and I was ready to go. The app itself is user-friendly and offers a wide range of customization options, such as scheduling timers, adjusting color temperatures, and creating scenes.In terms of energy efficiency, the Tapo Smart Bulb is a winner. With a power consumption of only 60W, I have noticed a significant decrease in my energy bills since switching to this smart bulb. The ability to dim the light and set timers also helps to further conserve energy.The color-changing feature of the bulb is a fun addition, allowing me to set the mood with a variety of colors to choose from. Whether I want a bright white light for working or a soft warm light for relaxing, the Tapo Smart Bulb delivers.Overall, I highly recommend the Tapo Smart Bulb, Smart Wi-Fi LED Light to anyone looking to upgrade their lighting setup. Its ease of use, energy-saving capabilities, and compatibility with smart home assistants make it a must-have for modern households.",5.0,2024-04-13,United Kingdom
R3OP7NOF0SR0JY,"Decided to switch from testing the cheaper Govee alternative (which would flicker randomly) to Tapo as I use plenty of Kasa/Tapo smart plugs throughout the house. I had high hopes for this light bulb but unfortunately it wasn't a great as i'd thought it would be. Using Scenes is limited, practically unsupported over Alexa and doesn't give you the range the previous Govee had. To make matters worse, the transistion between cycling colours is awful, the light just seems to do a hard switch between the colour even if you set it to ""breathing"" and reduce the speed. If you drop the brightness it just wants to practically turn off between each colour. I've decided now to give Wiz a go as that also support Matter and has other features such as built proximty awareness. If you want a simple colour change, this will do, but any features beyond leaving it on one colour I wouldn't really bother.",2.0,2025-02-05,United Kingdom

R5TB8MVNM9R4H,"At first I didn’t quite know if this was going to be useful. I bought it for the main light in my living room. When linked to Alexa the children had lots of fun asking Alexa to change the colour 45 times an hour. We moved house and had a baby, and got two more of these lightbulbs for lamps. They are brilliant now, as long as everyone remembers to use Alexa or the app rather than the switch!Great to be able to adjust brightness and colour while baby is asleep, without talking and using the app. There is also a party mode which flashes all the colours, pretty good for a kitchen disco 🤩",5.0,2024-10-09,United Kingdom

R33P6I6KT14GVA,"I have a talktalk router which broadcasts 5ghz and 2.4ghz bands at the same time.I bought 5 of these bulbs, three of them connected via the Tapo App relatively easily, the other two I could not get to connect. It always went through to the pairing stage of the setup process and then failed.I tried turning off the 5ghz band on my talktalk router via the admin backend. But this didn't work. After multiple attempts including swapping the bulbs around, I gave up and was considering sending them back. However at the time I was also looking for better wifi coverage in my home so despite my experience and with some reservations I bought the TP-Link Deco X20 AX1800 Mesh wifi system on Prime day. This set up very easily and it gave me the ability through the Deco app to turn off the 5ghz wifi with a simple button, and then once that was done I managed to connect the last two Tapo bulbs easily. (they still wouldn't connect with the 5ghz band active even through the Deco routers).I find it a bit strange that every other device I have that uses the 2.4ghz network has had no problem connecting to my original router and yet these bulbs seem to have a problem, and also why some connected and some didn't, hence why I give this product a 4 star rating.Now they are connected I am very happy with the light they put out, the Tapo app is easy enough to use and allows you to set up different shortcuts to turn on/off the lights in the various colours etc as well as other useful options such as grouping them by room/name and automation options like turn off lights at midnight, turn on at sunset etc.I also like the way they integrate with alexa automatically getting detected and then voice control is possible as well as alexa suggesting routines that you might like to use.",4.0,2022-07-20,United Kingdom

R1EGSJ4CFWD7B9,"I bought this mat to place on the tiles just inside the external conservatory door. I chose the anthracite 40 cm by 60 cm from the several options available.It arrived rolled up with sticky tape, and when opened out, it didn’t lie flat, which concerned me. After leaving it overnight, a couple of creases still remained. To help it flatten, I placed it on the floor in front of the living room fire, and after another day or so, it settled perfectly flat. Phew. A helpful tip: be patient for a couple of days, as it needs time to flatten down 😉The underside has a textured rubber surface that provides a non-slip effect. I tested it (see video above) by rubbing my feet on it quite vigorously, and it adhered to the floor very well, although this may depend on the type of flooring. In terms of trip hazard safety, it is excellent The rubber edges are tapered, leaving virtually no lip to catch on. I deliberately scuffed the toes of my shoes against the edge, and they just slid across without snagging.My conservatory opens outward, but if you're planning to place the mat under an inward-opening door, I tested it under my garage back door for clearance (see photo above). There is a gap of roughly half an inch (12 mm) between the door’s  bottom edge and the floor, and it cleared easily without brushing its surface at all, so this mat could be a suitable choice for that type of position.The top surface is short but reasonably soft and feels sturdy, effectively cleaning the soles of my shoes when I come in from the garden.The quality is what I hoped for; I found no imperfections upon arrival, and it feels tough, waterproof, and durable. All good so far.- Pros:• Reasonable price; good value for money.• Neat and smart appearance.• Durable; looks almost new after five months.• Versatile, practical thickness allows opening doors to clear easily.• Machine and hose washable for easy cleaning.• Good slip & trip resistance.- Cons:• Required a couple of days to flatten before use.• The thin pile, versus coir type, may not suit everyone unless door clearance is a consideration.After using this mat regularly for five months, it still looks pretty much as good as the day it arrived, so it’s five stars from me.I hope you found this review helpful.",5.0,2024-10-07,United Kingdom
ROEKGWISPH563,Versatile door mats which come in different sizes to suit particular door ways.  I've got three dogs so the rubber backing is a godsend as they don't slip.  Durable and don't shed like a cork mat can. Easy to clean and look great.,5.0,2025-03-04,United Kingdom

RA0XF6J6XM8I4,"I wanted a kmat for my back door which would actually remove dirt from shoes and boots when people rubbed their feet on it. As we live in a coastal resort, there's always a lot of sand from the local beaches being walked in.I've had several other mats which were useless at cleaning shoes and was fed up with dirt, stones and sand being walked in through the kitchen.This is the first mat that has done what it's supposed to do, it cleans the majority of dirt off shoes and I've found there's  a lot less being walked in.There's a good selection of colours for this rug and i chose a lovely anthracite colour which blends in with my tiles.It came folded up rather than rolled up which was good as I'd no curled up edges to flatten out.I'm disabled and in a wheelchair so i like the fact it doesn't have a deep pile so I can use my long handled brush and shovel to give it a good clean.The negative points I'd have to make is, this is described as being heavy duty. I don't have a lot of upper body strength but I find this mat quite light. I've had a lot heavier mats in the past.Also I have  this mat on tiles, and although it's supposed to be non slip, it moves about all over the place. I would put this down to the fact it's so light.I find the fact it really does clean shoes makes it well worth the money.It's just a pity it moves about so easily.",5.0,2024-12-25,United Kingdom

R3W49M8UV5WZ71,I ordered several of these mats. The red one shows the bits more than the darker colours.

R3DF21L42PFO1P,Unfortunately this mat had been folded into quarters and sealed in a small bag. Consequently the creases prevented it from lying flat which posed a serious hazard.

After using this mattress ""topper"" I can say its little more than a duvet. It is way to soft to give any support at all. I'm 19 stone mind so for a person a lot lighter than me it maybe fine but for me, I couldn't tell the difference between this and my daughter's single duvet.I havnt returned it as it isn't faulty. It is an extremely warm cover though!I think I'll need to try a memory foam type from somewhere but this will likely need to be ""tried"" in a store before I buy next time.Don't be put off by my update though.

I bought this to cushion a swivel chair which was too inflexible to be comfortable over long periods and I’m not convinced this makes it any more comfortable. Granted it is very flexible and this might well be its Achilles Heel. It is so squishable it offers very little padding.

One of the features I really like is that you can set it to move with you as you move in a room. For example in the kitchen it will move with me as I go about my cooking or cleaning so the screen is always visible. The large screen makes it easy to pop on the TV or read a recipe and the sound is clear and easily changed in volume.

R1NGUV5ZBWVXCF,"Wow an Amazon Echo that moves, should be fantastic right. Well in many respects it is, but they really have let this horse out of the stable before it can run.There are some great features:Much improved screen resolution compared to the Show 10 2nd Gen.Comparable or slightly better sound compared to the Show 10.That's about it for the better features.Oh nearly forgot, the camera is a lot better.Most features are about the same as on the previous echo show 10.However, the headline feature, the movement is a massive let down.I have now tried this in 2 locations and have had issues in both.I find that sometimes it turns all the way to it's rear most position for no apparent reason. I think it may be ashamed of itself??It tracks very erratically. I was on a video call yesterday and instead of smoothly tracking me (I was sat down at the time) it was moving around like a drunk trying to sit on a bar stool.I get the impression that both specific location and light levels effect the movement massively. And before you say it Amazon, no we should not have to contact you for technical support. This is a mainstream product that most people should be able to use with ease, not require a degree to calibrate correctly.Now for the camera position, who thought it would be a great idea to put it in the corner of the display???What were they consuming on that particular day? When tracking the entire screen looks over my left shoulder. I think it may be seeing ghost's??? Or perhaps it simply cannot line up easily as the camera is mounted on the right of the screen?Low light, oh dear ""expletive"". In normal evening light (where you and I can see clearly) you lose the movement all together. Did they only test this in a lab with super bright lighting. Didn't anyone take it home to test???You can also use it for a remote security camera. Great eh? Well only if the room is super well lit and the unit is not in Do Not Disturb mode. Ahhhhh, What is going on. I have 2 other Pan and Tilt cameras (not made by Amazon) and these can move it total darkness. So why do I need 10,000 lumens to operate this camera????I have another big bug bare. I have this Echo show in my living room and I have the new Show 15 in my kitchen. The closest Echo should respond to you, when they are both set as Alexa. When I am next to the living room Echo the kitchen Echo responds virtually all the time. I have now had to rename my kitchen echo show to ""echo"" to prevent some serious echo abuse! They are approx. 6 metres apart and this even happens when the kitchen door is closed.So what do I think and would I buy another? Well if you ignore the movement side of things then this is a great Echo Show. The screen is great and you can really see the difference when the show 10 2nd gen and 3rd gen are next to each other. But the movement side of things is so poor that I am considering sending mine back.If you already have an Echo Show 10 second gen I would not upgrade. If you are looking at a totally new large echo show then maybe it is worth it, but I would also consider the show 15 if lots of base is not important to you.So my message to Amazon is fix the issue with the movement issues then this will be a great addition to a smart home, as it is I would recommend either the Echo show 10 2nd gen or the new Show 15, which I am very impressed with.",4.0,2021-12-18,United Kingdom

R1KHYC9TLVL6YV,"This is an amazing piece of kit! The 10.1 inch Screen is bright with very sharp images and I love the motion tracking feature. (This really impressed my wife- she now loves this and all my other Echo products around the house).Set-up is simple if you have an Amazon account and it has to be placed on a flat secure surface or it notifies you and goes idle, until it is secure. It has a very wide turning circle so give it a clear space either side.I haven't set up the Echo to Echo video feature with the Echo Show 8 in the Living Room room. (I want to surprise my wife with this feature) so we have that to look forward to very soon.It is very expensive though, but I feel a very worth while investment, especially if you don't want to pay for a high grade speaker system.It feels sturdy, but is not too heavy and looks fantastic with it's simple styling and set up giving it a futuristic look and feel.The sound quality is excellent too and being able to watch Netflix and Prime Video is just great.This is by far the best Echo Show model I have seen, to date and I love it!Update: I have now tried the video chat and it works a treat. My wife is very pleased she doesn't always have to msg me if I'm in my ""study"" and we can chat face-to-face.

RB0JYARKK5SRA,"I bought this to replace our previous Echo Show 10 model. While there are definitely some big improvements, it still feels as though the newest Echo Show 10 is missing some basic features that I would have expected to be included in newer models by now.So let's start with what's better than the previous model:1) Processing power - unlike the previous model, this one doesn't stutter or freeze. It handles things pretty smoothly.2) It moves - it's a handy feature in an open plan room, especially in a kitchen/ diner, where you're moving about the room and might be cooking, following a recipe or playing music. It's also a great feature for checking in on the dogs if I'm out.Now let's look at what's worse:1) Sometimes I find myself shouting at Alexa to even get her to hear me on this model. It can be very frustrating and doesn't work as well as the previous version. And even when it finally does hear me, it doesn't always get it right. I've changed the name on our devices to 'Ziggy' and the number of times she's played music by Ziggy Marley is extremely frustrating.2) The sound quality is good. I wouldn't say it's worse than the old model, but it's different and the bass isn't as punchy.Now let's look at what needs to be improved:1) Volume control - When you adjust the volume, the volume of everything is increased or decreased. I don't want Alexa booming at me when I'm playing music loud. She doesn't need to as whatever she is playing is reduced as soon as it hears her name so it can hear what you're saying. I've never understood why she needs to shout back at you when the music volume is automatically lowered! I want to be able to control the volume independently for voice responses, music, alarms and notifications.2) Personalisation - Amazon has a habit of creating very bland alarm tones, notifications and jingles (like the power on jingle when you start up a Firestick that sounds like tripping over in mud). Some of us would like to hear a futuristic tone, acoustic sounds, nature sounds, jazz sounds etc. I would like to make my Alexa my own, not what a megacorp decides I should like.3) Output - I want to be able to play my music through Bluetooth speakers, but I only want the music to be played through the speakers, nothing else... No Alexa voice, no alarms, no notifications, no recipe instructions... Just my music. Notifications and Alexa voice etc could still be played through my Echo but I'd like to keep them separate.4) Design - The design of the Echo Show 10 is nice but it's not very futuristic. The edge/bezel of the screen is still far too thick. The camera needs to move to a central point above the screen. There is nothing ""wrong"" with the design. It's just when customers buy an Echo, they buy it because it's convenient and also because the idea is still a little bit futuristic. It would be nice to see a sexy and sleek Echo device that looks as though it's come from  2050, not 2015. The whole point of Alexa when Amazon first released it was that it was futuristic. Back then it didn't need to look futuristic because the whole concept was. But speaking to Alexa is now a normal part of our lives so the look of the device is now even more important than it was originally.5) Privacy - I would really like to see much more on device processing.6) Video calls - I use videos calls 90% of the time rather than voice calls on my phone. I would use video calling on my Echoes too if the apps were available. It would be great to see more video call apps included with the Echo... Google Meet, Messenger, WhatsApp, Zoom and Skype.So am I glad I upgraded? Definitely YES. Using the new Echo Show 10 is nice, cleaner and the processing power increase makes a huge difference. But I'm just a little bit disappointed that the features, design and technology haven't really progressed that far. I've really only bought this upgrade as using Alexa has become a necessary part of our every day life in our household. It controls lights, TVs, plugs, music and much more. Our old Echo was showing its age and this new one is really only a small upgrade but in my opinion, the next version needs a pretty massive overhaul of some basic features and design to stay ahead of the competition.Update: I've had this a while now and everything was ok until it started showing adverts. I don't want adverts in my kitchen countertop. It's intrusive and cheapens the whole idea of having an Echo Show. As a result, I've now dropped my rating to just 1 star as the adverts haven't stopped. I won't be purchasing any more Echo Shows if this is what's happening from now on. Either Amazon is upfront and tells customers adverts are a part of a product or they should allow customers to get a discount if they allow adverts on their Echo device. Introducing advers AFTER someone has already purchased your product is a quick way for customers to lose trust in Amazon.",1.0,2024-03-10,United Kingdom

This is supposed to be a premium product - not a concessionary model filled with advertising to compensate low cost - like the Amazon tablets....I bought this for the video calling features - which are shit.

R18P3J03JOJ309,"This Amazon Alexa Show 10 3rd Gen is a beautiful design , bad sadly It was not up to scratch at all. The Item came with 2 new software upgrades required and it then had to go through multiple on/off and download Install sequences before I could get it set up, I spent well over an hour on this sequencing. Finally when set up after about 2 hours, the Alexa interface was noticeably very slow. Responses would take a long time, this appeared indicative of a large system lag. This was not apparent or has ever been an issue on any of my other Alexa devices, which I then compared with on the same Internet connection. The Alexa's in my other rooms were all answering me while the Show 10 was still showing a blue voice indicator and no Alexa voice response forthcoming. Even just asking Alexa 'hello"" was lagging and even timing out, while the other units were all responding nearby in the other rooms.  I also found the motion detection to be too gimmicky and because the unit was so slow It became very annoying seeing it rotating the screen round while I just wanted communication, I switched this feature off , but it didn't improve the lag. I realise motion detection is a good adaptation for monitoring and reacting to the users position and remote camera access etc,  but it was not for me due to the performance lag. I persevered and tried other solutions including resetting and restarting my Internet connection, but it was the same,  far too slow.  I assume the cloud interface had too large a lag on my connection. I eventually had to give up, I I noticed some other reviews also mentioned a slow interface, but I thought this would not affect me, so I went ahead with purchase. In retrospect It appears these unit require a better and faster processor or they need excellent connectivity with the cloud to work without a noticeable lag. Hopefully a future Alexa Show 10 really addresses this issue as it was disappointingly poor and I had unfortunately to return the unit. I am now stuck with needing a satisfactory replacement and will have to live with my Show 8 units until a better solution or upgrade comes out from Amazon.  I want one that performs.",3.0,2024-10-09,United Kingdom

Motion sensor is a new gimmic & you do need to set this up via screen instructions, feels wierd the screen following you at first.So to sum up I'm very happy with my new Echo 10 so far but as you will notice I have only given it four stars.The reason for this is my product details in settings list my model as a 1st generation model not a 3rd generation model listed above? Also I cannot rename my unit from Alexa to another wake up name on this unit. I have renamed other units easily in the past & KNOW how to do it. So there we have it a good unit with a few niggling issues on my part.",4.0,2024-07-21,United Kingdom
R3RYUN55QXKZK9,"It could be great, but is ruined by adverts.Alexa's already useful, but being backed up by the screen adds that little bit of extra content that really enhances it. For instance being able to see a timer as it's active, or display recipes on it. Also, support for things like youtube and Netflix are great for playing stuff in the background. The only downside (apart from ads), is the lack of a real touch screen interface. You have to trigger pretty much every app/skill via voice commands before you can start I teracting with them on the screen.And that brings me onto the adverts. They are CONSTANT. It feels like every time I look over at it there's a new ad being displayed. If there isn't one for some reason, giving alexa a command will make sure to correct that.I can understand the occasional ad on cheaper echo devices to help pay for alexa's servers, but the amount being displayed is ridiculous, especially on a device that costs £250. Also, I feel like as a Prime member I shouldn't be seeing any. If Amazon needs more money, how about deleting that stupid AI chat bot which keeps getting in the way on the amazon shopping app; it must cost a load to run, and just puts me off using the site.",2.0,2025-02-12,United Kingdom
R28B5OWC2943SG,"The Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) is indeed an innovation that endeavours to harmonise the user experience with an appealing design. The advances from previous versions are notable and praiseworthy, albeit with room for improvements. To encapsulate the device's performance, it would be fair to say that its usefulness oscillates between being a shining star and a clouded afternoon. Let's get into the nitty-gritty.The UpsideFirst and foremost, it's compelling how the device attempts to synchronise with your movements - an effort that lends a sort of ""personality"" to this tech gadget, which in my case, managed to keep it out of the storage drawer (much unlike previous Echo Dots that failed to retain engagement). The 10.1"" HD screen that follows you around the room makes the Echo Show 10 a splendid company for video calls or binge-watching your favourite series on Prime Video or Netflix. Furthermore, the integration with smart home devices adds to its charm and utility, making tasks from setting up Zigbee devices to monitoring your home remotely a breeze.The Echo Show 10 also impresses with its audio output. The sound quality is top-notch, the speakers delivering a premium, directional sound that is perhaps the best amongst all the Alexa devices I've owned. The option to play TV series, music, and podcasts from a myriad of sources, including Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify, makes it a versatile entertainment unit.The device's additional perks, like a friendly kitchen companion with BBC Good Food recipes or a digital photo frame with adaptive colour, are a cherry on top.The DownsideOn the flip side, however, the device's commendable efforts can sometimes falter, much like a cloud cover on a sunny day. The major letdown is the headline feature - the motion tracking. It can feel rather erratic and inconsistent, moving like a drunk at times, while at others, going completely AWOL in low light conditions. This issue seems exacerbated in certain room locations and under specific lighting, making the product feel a bit premature for a mainstream audience.The issue with responsiveness to voice commands when the music is playing is also noticeable. There were instances where I had to raise my voice to catch Alexa's attention.And lastly, the lack of app compatibility is somewhat disappointing, considering the device's potential as a central entertainment hub. Amazon should certainly work on incorporating popular platforms like Disney Plus.ConclusionAll things considered, the Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) is a solid addition to the smart home ecosystem and a worthy contender in the Alexa device range. The splendid screen quality, excellent sound output, and added features make it a delightful purchase. However, Amazon could do well to address the device's motion-related drawbacks and app compatibility issues. Therefore, I award it 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile and dynamic smart home device, but with the disclaimer about its few quirks.",4.0,2023-07-21,United Kingdom
R2ARX1BK10WU6U,This is a great upgrade from my Echo Show 8 Gen1 however I have dropped a star because the sound isn’t quite as good as my old Echo show 8.

R30RNSNZLNA6OP,We bought this as a central hub for use in the kitchen of our new Smart Home.It worked brilliantly for just under 2 years and then started to glitch.It would start playing games or starting skills or audiobooks in the middle of the night with no scheduled routines. I actually suspect it to have been an issue with the touch screen mistakenly detecting touches . When we called support neither they or we were able to determine exactly what was triggering the device to misbehave.Multiple wipes and reconfigurations were attempted and none were ultimately performing any different. It is a shame as it was a useful item ont he kitchen island and if in a video call it could track your movement around the room.We have since replaced it witht he latest Echo 8 (at our own expense) and the issues have all gone so was definitely a hardware issue on the Echo Show 10.

R73JG3ZHMSCD2,"Update 4 days later‐---------------So all the problems described in my original review ""went away"". Suspiciuosly, this happened just after an Amazon customer service rep tried to contact me, presumably about this review.  I say presumably,  as they'd just started to introduce themselves and were cut off, never to be seen again.Anyway,  I presume they force-updated my unit,  and all the voice commands are back. Look left, and look right really make a difference,  having some control over her movements makes a big difference!View camera now works,  and even from other alexa shows. You get pinch to zoom, and swipe to pan,  works very well.I'm withholding one star for the rocky start,  but if it all goes well,  i'll upgrade later.Original 2 star review---------The Good------------Camera is much improved, with a much wider angle view. The sound from the speaker seems a bit better than the last generation, but as I route music to an Echo Link, I don't really care. Screen seems about the same, possibly a bit brighter. The zoom is great when it's working.The Bad-----------The software is buggy as hell. This is not a finished product.I hope that sometime in the future they bother to do some QA, then release a final version of the software,  as it's pretty bad right now.On day one it would respond to request to ""Look left"" and ""Look right"" this is super useful when you are all at a table, and you want to get various people in frame. On day 2. Nope. ""I'm not sure"" or ""I don't know how to do that"" etc. If I didn't have witnesses, I'd doubt it had even been a feature. When ""tracking"" a stationary seated child, suddenly it will pan off to look in the opposite direction for no reason.""Stop tracking Me"" or ""Tracking off"" or every variation you can imagine of this now fails. On day 1 it worked fine. It's essentially like the voice part of the software has forgotten that the Alexa can move.Drop-in doesn't seem to work reliably with this one either. ie, if you are elsewhere and you use a show 5, it just goes to a ""drop-in"" static screen, and doesn't ever connect, mostly. Sometimes instead it just gives you audio.The Pan and Zoom are possessed. It's like you have a drunk cameraman with ADD. the shot pans and zooms all over the place. Sometimes it gets distracted and voosh, off pans the shot to something unrelated.Also the remote control from your Alexa app (to use it as a security camera), doesn't work. It just gave a static screen.So if the movement and zooming could be reliably controlled, this would be worth it, as it is, it's a frustrating product that's almost (but not quite) unusable. Is it better than the previous version? Well, if you grab the screen and override the motor, or possibly limit it's motion to nothing (which you can do in software), then you have a unit with a much better camera (which it needed) - but at great cost.Come on Amazon, you can get this right!",4.0,2021-05-31,United Kingdom

RCP5XLL63W7KC,"I also own a static Amazon Echo 10 and this revolving upgrade appealed. This is an initial review as I only purchased it yesterday. In almost every respect it is identical to my static Echo and compares favourably. However, I am very disappointed currently with the rotation. It responds every time to my voice, so that is good, but facial recognition is appalling. I have it on a pedestal drawer unit in a standard lounge with two ceiling lights. The facial recognition keeps saying it is too dark to operate. My room is perfectly well lit and when using Apple FaceTime I have no problems. I do not want to live under a spotlight and I believe the Echo leaves a lot to be desired. It cannot be beyond the wit of Amazon to have installed a camera and software capable of normal lounge lighting. The remote security camera and video calling work well. I will carry on reviewing the product, but if my opinion does not change I will be returning it. I will issue an updated review soon.Update - the Echo seems to have improved and begun to recognise me. Still no good in low light. Sometimes you need to say Follow Me to wake it, but if it is awake then it does follow ok. My opinion is definitely improving.Update 10 Feb 2022. Been using it for while now and getting used to it. Video and sound very good. However, it’s following software needs an update, it’s very hit and miss and requires excellent illumination. In normal lounge lighting the following is very poor.

We purchased this mainly for its screen size over anything else as we want it to display our ring cameras on demand and doorbell. so the larger size makes it easier to see at distance.The screen is ok at best, it suffers from alot of backlight bleed and seems to have higher than normal IPS glow. Obviously an OLED panel in this ‘always on’ scenario would be a poor choice but i wish Amazon sourced a better panel or implemented it better.Sound is great. Its not boomy or room filling to be honest but its slightly better than our gen 1 echo.The motion is gimmiky to be honest. You call for alexa and it turns to you which is great. But it takes way to long to reset back to your preferred ‘standby’ position and on the occasion alexa think your talking to her and your not (its the tv, another convo, odd sound etc’ it will just randomly turn in that direction and proceed to stay there. Quite annoying.I also wish the info on the screen was a bit more customisable. I’d like to be able to get weather, time, some news (actual stuff i feel is relevant nit what amazon thinks is) and some other info on just one screen panel, the size is now there so let us use it!For what we want it for (cameras mainly) it works fine and is a nice change from a screen-less gen 1 echo.

Due to illness I'm spending a lot of time in my bedroom & I wanted a multimedia device to stream the usual streaming sites + my vast library on cloud. This device comes with Netflix & Prime Video, as you'd expect, but a huge miss is the lack of a DLNA support or a dedicated Plex app. I CAN access my Plex server but it wasn't easy. Remote access has to be enabled at server & if you haven't got a plex pass you're limited to 1mbps which only gives you 320p playback👎🏻 as it's indirect access. Plex pass allows 2mbps so your videos are 720p which isn't ideal by today's standards but it's acceptable. The website can be accessed via the Amazon Silk browser. Quality settings need to be set equivalently (see pic).Otherwise, sound & screen quality are very good, 1080p on Prime Video etc. The sound was very bass-driven for me & I've had to adjust it in settings.Motion..

You can adjust the base but still miles behind its predecessor.. which is probably why Amazon still sell them on their website for more than the next generation.We were so impressed with the previous generation that we picked up second hand that we brought thre more to replace our second generation 5"" Echo shows and sold this one to a kid who liked the look but again in our opinion is easily pleased by what something looks like than quality.the screen feature looks cool but is overrated and in some parts less inferior than the old box looking non-screen moving shows.. Even the second generation 8"" echo Show in our opinion gives this a run for its money.If you want something that looks 'hi-tech' and that's more important than sound and functionality, then get this. If your more interested in sound and functionality than mouthing that looks 'hi-tech', get the second generation or if you have one of them keep hold of it. or get a second generation 8""Show as its a close runner sound wise and once again in our opinion functionality wise superior to one of these.",3.0,2023-07-04,United Kingdom
R2WVSZXR9S1OVR,"I recently purchased what was advertised as the new generation Echo Show 10 during the ongoing Black Friday sale for £179. However, I’ve encountered an issue with uploading photos from my phone using the Amazon Photos app. This device isn’t recognized by the app, so I went through all the settings in the Alexa app and on the device itself to troubleshoot. After investigating, I discovered that this is actually the first-generation model, despite being sold as the latest generation.Update: After contacting Amazon’s after-sales team, they resolved the issues with the device and even sent another Echo Show 10 to verify the generation. However, the replacement device also shows that it is an Echo Show 10 (1st Gen). Despite this, the customer service team has assured me that the device is the latest generation as advertised.

R2276BK1R9EU4H,Don't need to say much more others have already covered.my main bug bare with this echo show 10 is having to repeat yourself.all of my much much cheaper echoes are more responsive .I have tried everything to change this. volume level moving to different locations different heights.honestly save your money if your not bothered about motion tracking then go for much cheaper echoes .pictures good sounds good but honestly not worth the money.amazon need to some serious software updates for this unit.infact my echo flexes at £5 are 100 times more responsive am going to get rid of this as it is so annoying having to repeat yourself.will get much cheaper show 8 especially the offers can get four show 8s for the price of this.dissapointed is an understatement.dont buy.,4.0,2023-11-08,United Kingdom

R2GJC0BBFR98H0,"Like: Screen quality, moving screen/camera during calls, sound quality better than original show.Dislike: Recurrent adverts that are impossible to turn off depite googling for possible solutions (I will never look at another shark product again). When you feed back that an advert is not wanted, it will tell you that it will be hidden, then promptly shows it again and again and again interrupting photos etc. Unlike previous models, video from security cameras appear in a tiny window in the corner of the screen that requires you to manully expand to be reasonably visible (again, no option to alter).Conclusion: Unfortunately the bombardment of adverts (not seen on my older Echo Show) is so intrusive that I cannot recommend this product and I wish I'd not exchanged my older device.  To anyone visiting, the Show 10 appears to be a an advert for Amazon shopping and, in particular, a certain brand of vacuum cleaner.

R3R6CA9BM9H067,"This echo is absolutely fantastic, the screen quality is equivalent to a top end TV, the sound is superb and it’s a brilliant addition to any modern kitchen.Be very careful, during set up, be sure to activate tracking so that it follows you, also be very careful when you’re setting up profiles and make sure it knows everybody in the house by face, also control the rotation carefully so that it doesn’t bump into anything.Also, during dropping or video calls, it’s a good idea to not run around, give it time to recognise your face and try and move as gentle as you can and it will always track you and my daughter regularly tries to make it lose her and rarely succeeds…All the people that say that this doesn’t track you either haven’t set it up properly or are expecting too much of it, keep redoing the set up to make sure you get it exactly right, and if you can use it while facing the camera, you’ll have the best experience, Amazon are really not out the part for this device, especially at this price point during Blackfriday",5.0,2023-12-07,United Kingdom

R51SNRRABHCW9,"Right, don’t get me wrong, I love this item, but it’s not amazing, not sure I think it’s worth the money.Looks wise it looks great, the screen has a lot of bezel considering other tablets, but that’s not off putting.Sound is really good, to me, however I have noticed a little distortion on higher volumes at certain bass frequencies, but again, not off putting and for me, a massive jump from the google nest hub o had prior.The tablet is rubbish though, it’s slow and unresponsive. If you imagine a sub par android tablet, then you won’t be disappointed, but an iPad it isn’t. It does Netflix and prime easyish, although Netflix didn’t work out the box until I manually searched updates. And YouTube is just a bookmark to the webpage, it doesn’t even do Disney plus, which is a real shame. I’m not sure about prime but the google hub does the rest, with no webpages or workarounds, just opens the app. So overall the table is a 2/10 for me.It controls my home really well, if not better than google did however the google app is 100 times better, the Alexa app is a little confusing and isn’t the best for families as you all need separate profiles otherwise Spotify doesn’t work properly. But if you all have separate profiles you have to tell Alexa to switch profiles, even though it knows who it’s taking to. And the devices that I as the account holder have already intergrated don’t auto pop on other peoples profiles like they do with google. These are more gripes with Alexa as whole though and not the device itself but for a family, ease of use definitely goes to google again.Overall, although my review seems really negative, I still love it and am really enjoying my purchase, it’s just I kind of wish the device was made by google.",3.0,2022-02-27,United Kingdom

RWF1AI5MQ7MT7,I’m new to Alexa so it’s been an experience.. Iv had more arguments with Alexa than I did with my ex.. She can be a right royal pain in the…. Having said that.. Sound quality is pretty good.. Lots of bass which I had to tone down a bit. The “follow me” thing can be a bit irritating.. I sometimes think she’s been at the old vino.. I’m nowhere close to getting the best out of this atm and have had continuous issues setting things up (She hasn’t got a clue how to run my TV for example) And I was being forced to listen to Amazon music until I realised I could change the settings. I think a lot of it is just learning how to use the thing but it’s not as easy as you’d think.

RX3QCJXRHS27E,"We have been waiting for this to launch since last year when it was first announced.However delivery from Amazon is nearly an 8 week wait from launch but we managed to purchase this same day from Argos.We already have the Echo show 8 & 5 and the main reason we wanted to purchase this was the added benefit of motion detection and being able to check in on the house via the camera when we are not home.Overall it’s a great unit, the sound is incredible and the motor that enables movement is completely silent.Motion detection is incredibly accurate as it uses its camera & microphone to sense where you are standing but it will only work 100% in good light conditions and if there is more than 1 person walking about it can get ‘confused’ with which person to follow.Depending on where you wish to place the unit, you can set the movement parameters so it will not hit anything when motion detection is in use.You can also set a default position for which direction the unit will face when not in use.However it is slightly disappointing that the screen tilt can only be changed by hand as we wanted this to be able to monitor our dogs - on a hip-height table it’s is unable to view the surrounding floor inside a 10 foot perimeter.For anyone with Ring devices, this works seamlessly with the doorbell, floodlight, indoor camera & home security alarm kit.Also works well with controlling Hue lighting, Hive thermostat & Dyson Pure hot + cool fan.",5.0,2021-02-27,United Kingdom

I had also heard that it was wonderful for zoom calls.Nope!!  Zoom is only available in the US so not available in the UK with no indication it might come anytime soon.  My mistake for believing amazon reviews and not checking where they were posted from though.As for recipes? with no browser you are limited to whatever apps interact with echo shows - at first it was ok as the BBC Good Food app worked and I like their recipe then that was removed and it left me with predominantly US recipe apps that I didn't like and didn't have the right measurement info for.  I don't use ""cups"" for cooking or baking and this is what I was left with.I think you are so limited by the availability of specific apps or you have a large and very expensive echo dot that watches you move around the room (you can switch this off) but for me its just not worth the cost over a normal echo dot and definitely not worth the space on my kitchen worktop.  If there was a browser it would have been worth persevering but 9 months is long enough and I'm getting rid of it.Unfortunately the BBC app was removed more than 30 days after I bought this so I can't return it either.Overall very disappointed and will think much more carefully before buying anything other than a basic echo in future.The quality of screen is decent IF it does what you want AND the apps stay available - it did neither for me.",2.0,2023-08-15,United Kingdom

When you say the wake word, on occasion it turns in too far or completely the wrong direction.  At other times, when you’ve finished with it, it does not go back to its resting position so you have to get up and turn it yourself or adjust the settings.  This happens too often.  On other occasions, it just turns, out of the blue, when the wake word has not been used.  The motion however, is very good when using the Echo Show camera to look in on your room or to make a call and following you then is mostly accurate.  The sound is very good  with a lovely bass sound, particularly useful for reggae music.  All the other Echo Show features work well so on that basis it does not disappoint.

The integration of Alexa, as always, makes it convenient for managing smart home devices, checking the weather, and other routine tasks.However, my main concern was the speed of the device.

Although, I do wish there were more apps that were compatible such as Disney Plus. My family thought it was crazy to spend so much on a smart home device, and I will say it is a bit of a steep price but if you use Alexa for more than just a handful of task a day I personally would say it is worth it. Even they understand the usability of it now. Only one thing I have noticed is that when music is playing(not extremely loud) and you call Alexa due to the screens position at different angles it doesn’t detect your voice over the music as quickly as the normal echo does.

We wanted to put it on the wall as it was too big for our current TV unit.I researched various wall brackets from budget to higher priced items, but in the end decided on this bracket as it had such great consistent reviews even though it was currently listed at an amazing price of £12.00.  Another draw was that it would be a close to the wall fitting which was important as I didn't want to be able to see too much of what was behind the TV when walking into the room.It arrived the next day in a very small box, and it included every needed for a neat installation.  Several different VESA screw sizes and various spacers to suit different size TV's.  It all felt very sturdy and well made.  There were also some wall fixings, but not suitable for my hollow plasterboard wall, but I knew that as the advert clearly states not for use on hollow walls.  This is clearly down to not being supplied with the correct fixings, but I already had these at home ready.The bracket was very quick and straightforward to fit and even included a small spirit level.  I gave that a try, but it was not very accurate, so I used my own spirit level instead.  The bracket has a tilt adjustment which I had to set right back as I did not want it leaning forward, so it is now perfectly parallel to the wall.

R1RSGV1VCCWQJ0,"I wasn't sure when I opened the box to be honest. It looked a bit small.But I needn't have worried. It was just a lot smaller than the one I had been using before. It has a fairly limited angle on it - so ignore that ridiculous picture showing it hanging off the wall at a huge angle. It won't do that, but why would you want to anyway?Easy to install into a solid wall (which are easier to do, I know). The mounting plate is not wide but it's OK to mount the TV on to, if you are careful and have put the mounting brackets on the TV properly. Lots of fittings are provided & I found the right ones for my TV with no issues. Make sure you use the spacers and put the brackets on the right way round (left and right). There is no spirit level provided so you need to have one of those already.Overall it does a good job of hanging a big TV on a wall with the right tilt, without it sitting away from the wall at all. This is a plus, but also a small negative & my only one. As it has a very low profile, access to the back of the TV is very limited. This is OK if you are not planning to change your connected devices too much. But it could be a problem if you need access to the back of your TV a lot.If a sleek, low profile design is what you are after then you have found it. If you are looking to plug things in and out of your TV all the time, move on, this isn't the one for you.I'd buy it again. Thanks for reading.",5.0,2021-11-19,United Kingdom

RYB52W6RN0J01,"The ninja dual zone Air fryer has a huge 7.6 L total capacity. There is two individual baskets which are 3.8 L each. It has six programs, which are Air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate, Max crisp and reheat. If you are only going to use one of the baskets then zone one is the default zone to cook with, but what I particularly like about this is that for instance you can air fry at 200° in zone one for 30 minutes and you can roast in zone two at 180° for 20 minutes at the same time by pressing sync and then start.  This will start zone one and when it reaches the 20 minute timer zone two will come off of hold and start roasting. If you remove the basket such as for chips to give them a shake, then the timer will pause until The basket is re-inserted and if both zones are cooking it will pause both timers. The other option that I really like which is nice and easy and can maximise your output if you’re cooking the same thing, For example if you had to Air fryer 1.5 kg of chips. Then place your chips in both baskets and on the zone one display enter in your temperature timer and press match then start. This will duplicate all of the information to zone two, Which makes it easy and super efficient. The max crisp is set at 240° and this is the only function that The temperature can’t be changed, and it could be set to a maximum time of 30 minutes. The air fryer function can be set between 150 and 210° and has a time range between 1 minute to 1 hour. The roast function allows you to use the ninja as a conventional oven which has a temperature range of 120 to 210° and has a timer that can be set from one minute to four hours. The reheat function has a temperature setting of 130 to 210° and can be set from 1Minute to One hour. The dehydrate function allows you to gently remove moisture from meat, vegetables and fruits. This temperature can be set between 40 to 90° and has a set time of up to 12 hours allowing you to create healthy snacks. The bake function means that you don’t have to wait the usual 10 to 15 minutes that your conventional oven would take to pre-heat Which is perfect if you just want to knock up a quick dessert. The temperature setting is 120 to 210° and has a time range between 1 minute to 4 hours. This ninja air fryer is super easy to clean, compare to my previous Tower Air fryer baskets. Overall we are very satisfied with our purchase as it has so many functions, Not just an air fryer. I hope you have found my review helpful.",5.0,2021-07-17,United Kingdom
R28N87XKCTTK8A,"The best thing about this product is that it pays for itself through energy savings  Since getting this Ninja my deep fat fryer is now obsolete, my grill is almost obsolete and my oven hasn't been used since.This product cooks great chips but one does have to learn a little first.  When cooking chips it's critical that one folows the instructions and washes the potato starch out before air frying them otherwise they will burn.  Next one needs to work out the times and temperatures for different potato varieties  as cooking times do vary between the different types.  Once one has a good idea of the cooking times and temperatures chips are quickly produced in the air fryer.Although the air fryer works well there are the other options available; Roast, Bake, Dehydrate, Max Crisp and reheat.  As the saying goes, ""practice makes perfect"" and it certainly applies to this Ninja.  One has fun messing with this product as one tries to find the best and most successful way to cook food.  Roasting duck breasts is a typical example.  I have cooked them with the Roast option but I have found that they cook best by giving them 8 minutes on Roast followed by six minutes on Max crisp to get the skin well cooked and crispy.As  my images show, this ""compact cooker"" roasts some great chicken quarters.  The same applies with the chicken as it does the duck, partially roast the chicken and finish off using the max crisp setting which operates at 240c and that is 10c higher than domestic ovens so it cooks and crisps skin perfectly and quickly.I have used this Ninja for toasting garlic bread slices and it does it much quicker and much better than my Solarplus grill does so that is something exceptional.As this Ninja has much smaller cavities than a domestic oven it can rapidly heat up, that is how it works.  When cooking there is no need to preheat the Ninja as the cavities reach their temperatures in a matter of a small few seconds and that is where the energy savings come into play.  By not having to pay to preheat a large cavity domestic oven ones uses much less energy thus one isn't paying the 30p+ per kWh for an element that requires a 3.6+kWh input.  If one has a cheap cooker then it's cheap for a reason... it needs more energy thus it would probably use a good kWh just to preheat the oven so one can easily be paying 40p to 50p just to warm the oven up.  A more expensive cooker, like mine, can have triple glazing in the oven doors thus they are much more enrgy efficient and save money when comared to cheaper cookers.  As the Ninja only has to heat up a small space the food is cooking almost immediately and it does cook evenly.I did mention duck, chicken and garlic bread but what about roasting coffee beans?  I did think about it and after doing a little reading online I tried it.  I don't advise using this Ninja for roasting coff beans as it does become ""expensive"".  Many people claim that one can get a ""dark roast"" in six to eight minutes, with others claiming it takes around 15 minutes.  Well, I don't believe any of them have actually tried it as even after a good 1/2 hour the beans were only light roasted.  To get a dark roast will tale close to one hour at the highest temperature so that becomes costly for a small amount of coffe bean.  One can invest in a domestic coffee bean roaster but personally I do prefer to do it the traditional way, which is much more cost effective.  One simply puts the beans into a pan (frying pans are good for this) or a traditional roasting pan that imported.  Next, one simply heats the pan on a high heat hob or gas burner for a few minutes.  Whilst the beans are roasting one simply stirs them around from time to time.  A light roast, like what the Ninja produced, can be obtianed in only two to three minutes with a dark raost taking around five mionutes.  What the Ninja produced in 1/2 hour would have taken me around 10 minutes and I would have got two small batches of dark roast for my espressos.So, this Ninja is excellent for cooking almost anything but there will be the exception such as my fresh green bean coffee.It is so easy to keep clean so that is a very good bonusOne thing I did note from some negative reviews is that some reviewers gave negative ratings and claimed the product is fauly because ""lots of steam"" was coming out.  Well, I can honestly say that is not the case.  The problem is not with the Ninja but is with the user.  During my second use of this I seen some steam coming out and instantly worked it out that the pan hadn't been insertred correctly.  When using the Ninja it is important to insert the pans flush so that they are firmply sealed with the machione otherwise steam will escape thus cooking will be uneven and will take longer.  As soon as I seen the steam I simply pulled pan number one out a bit and reinserted it thus no more steam.  Another issue with those that cook with incorrectly positioned pans is that apart fromcosting more to cook the food and not cooking the food well... it will dry the food.The steam from the cooking food is part of the cooking process and helps keep the food moist but losing the water will mean the food, especially meats, will go dry.Overall I am impressed with my Ninja and I should have bought one much sooner than I did as it is saving me money, it is saving me a lot of time and most importantly it produces some excellently cooked food.  One day I will risk it and try to make some jam in it and maybe even dehydrate some fruits.  If successful thenit will mean my dehydrater will become obsolete aling with my deep fat fryer.I am recommending this product as it is made to a high quality standard, it works very well and with the energy and cost savings this is very good value.",5.0,2023-09-07,United Kingdom

You can air fry, roast, bake, and reheat—it’s like having several appliances in one!

R1LXIJB7USUB6E,"We have never had an air fryer before but went for this one as it has a large capacity and has the dual draws which seemed great for cooking a lot of what the kids like to eat.You get a easy start up menu and a full manual with recommended temperatures.The manual is easy to follow and you can get started straight away. We purchased additional silicon inserts. Recommend the inserts as they are easy to clean.There are six settings air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, reheat, dehydrate.There is no recommendations in the manual for the foods listed to what setting you chose. You need to do this.First meal we cooked was 2x vegan Kiev and 2 portions of chips.Vegan kievs normally take 25mins at 180 in a fan oven. Chips 15 mins at 180 all once the oven has reached the temperature.I Set the oven on air fryer mode and set same times and temperature as for fan oven.Using the sync feature I was able to start cooking so they finish at the same time.I decided to keep my eye on how everything was going so I didn’t burn anything.After 18 mins the kievs appeared done and the bread crumbs crisp so I checked the chips which still had 7 mins left and they were just starting to crisp but were a golden colour.One thing to note is if you have over done the cooking time on one item but sync the trays you don’t have the option to just have the other tray still going unless you empty the tray and run the clock down on the empty tray. Otherwise you can turn off and reset the timer on the other tray which is what I did as it only takes a few seconds. Note if you open one tray you shut down the cooking in both trays when using the sync feature.I switched off and set the time for 3 mins on the fries. The fry’s came out perfectly crisp without being burnt but only took 12 mins.The second meal I cooked was 2 vegan pukka pies. You can get two pies in one tray. Cooking time 25 mins at 190 in the fan oven. Pies cooked in 18 mins on the bake function without a soggy bottom.The cooking time could possibly been reduced a few minutes. This was all again straight off so no warming up needed like our fan oven.The only thing we don’t like about it, is it radiates heat more so than the conventional fan oven. The kitchen felt very warm. Also although we have heat detector in the kitchen we have a smoke detector in the hall. Every time we cook the smoke detector in the hall goes off yet none of the food is burnt.The only comparison to this is when you have certain bread in the toaster you get some smoke which isn’t visible to the eye setting the alarm off.We have cooked fry’s so it may be the oil coating them is getting very  hot too quickly. We will need to experiment with reducing the temperature but increasing the cooking time. This will save closing the kitchen door.So be prepared to experiment on times and temperature etc. be prepared for a hot kitchen.Be prepared to cook food which tastes better than the oven.Be prepared not to have to wait for your oven to warm up.Use inserts and get wooden tongs as the inserts get very hot and it can be awkward to get them out the tray.",4.0,2023-09-09,United Kingdom

The modern design and compact size mean it doesn't dominate the space, yet it still packs a lot of power and functionality. Despite its compact design, it has a large capacity, making it ideal for family meals or batch cooking without taking up too much space. This balance between size and capacity is something many other appliances struggle to achieve, but the Ninja Foodi Max gets it just right.In terms of energy efficiency, the Ninja Foodi Max is a game-changer. I’ve noticed a decrease in my energy usage since I started using it. The combination of quick cooking times and efficient heat distribution means it consumes far less energy than using a conventional oven or stovetop. For instance, meals that used to take an hour or more in the oven now take half the time or less, thanks to the combination of pressure cooking and air frying. This not only saves energy but also significantly reduces the time I spend in the kitchen.Cleaning up after using the Ninja Foodi Max is a breeze. The non-stick, dishwasher-safe parts make it incredibly easy to clean, which is a huge plus after a long day. I appreciate that I don’t have to spend extra time scrubbing pots and pans, making the whole cooking experience more enjoyable from start to finish.Overall, the Ninja Foodi Max has exceeded my expectations. It's perfect for anyone looking to save time and energy without sacrificing the quality of their meals. With its stylish design, space efficiency, and ease of use, it has quickly become an indispensable part of my daily routine.",5.0,2024-08-24,United Kingdom
R1775UO5T273PV,Great product and easy to use. Its a fair size so make sure you have the room for it. Cooks food quicker than an oven. Looks quite good as well! Our microwave doubles as a small oven so we rarely ever with on main oven so its cost saving too.,5.0,2025-03-19,United Kingdom
R1297VDG5ZGY4S,"I thought now I've had it nearly a year I'd leave a review. Firstly go BIG to start with. Forget the smaller units, if you can afford it, get the large capacity Fryer to start with, then you won't have to upgrade and loft the smaller one. For energy saving it's a winner. We have a large Bosche oven and hob, great when energy was cheap, but now since we are retired and electricity prices are criminal they're impossible to run without breaking the bank. Cooking is now SO FAST! No more oven warm up, no longer waits, it's terrific. It does everything it says on the tin!Now the bits to watch for, not bad, but take note:-1) There are three of us at Christmas, and we had to use the cooker and hob for all the food as the Fryer was not big enough, you'll never do it, even with this bigger unit. It's lovely to use the cooker and hob a couple of times a year- Doesn't hurt!2) You'll need to use the Fryer combined with a Microwave, you'll get meals prepared much quicker, it's a winning combination. Works great for us.3) Be sure to get the silicon tray sets that insert into the drawers, keeps everything super clean, fast wash up, and they last a long time. Just be sure to wash everything up thoroughly, and a good wipe round. Our unit still looks brand new!4) When the drawers are hot after cooking, close them properly, don't leave them part-open. I've read the heat can delaminate the front fascia.(Ours are fine so far as we abide by this rule).5) The coating on the feet nodules (under the front of the drawers) wears off after many openings and closings, and ours have scratched our glass stand-alone hot plate. (Not a problem as easily replaced). But if you put your Fryer drawers down on your worktop BEWARE as they will scratch any surface.*Use an old, clean tea towel or heat proof mat to protect your worktop surface.6) Purchase a heat resistant Mat set (here on Amazon). Put the Fryer on those, when not in use the Fryer slides easily out of the way - Amazing!*We purchased a wooden hob cover, then two mats, then the Fryer on top. (We pulled the cooker and hob fuse in the circuit breaker box to be extra safe).So there we have it, what are you waiting for? Recommended 100%.Brilliant.",5.0,2025-01-30,United Kingdom
RGV5ODJP2NPVT,"I have had this product for almost 19 months and used it daily. A month ago it developed a fault in that only Drawer 2 side would work. For Drawer 1 it would accept the settings but the heating element and fan did not work. I decided finally to call Ninja's customer support (on a Friday afternoon). Connection to a human was almost immediate and they did a video call where I showed them the machine. To my delight they offered to send a new replacement minus the 2 drawers. They told me it could take up to 5 days. On Saturday, I went to a pre-arranged meeting with a friend only to find on my return that DPD had tried to deliver the replacement. It was delivered at lunchtime on Sunday. Excellent service from all involved. Thank you very much.",5.0,2025-03-03,United Kingdom
R1MADITESFH7SJ,"I do like a Ninja product but I had not purchased a Ninja air fryer because to be honest I thought it’s all about the name and how can it be that different from any other air fryer. Well….we did have a cheaper, one drawer air fryer and it did do the job but we used it a lot and found that it really was not big enough. It has gone to a good home and now we have this and we are thrilled with it. I thought it was going to be over complicated but it isn’t. We use it daily and we do use the ‘sync’ and the ‘match’ functions. Originally we bought an air fryer because the kids would put the oven on for a chicken kiev and a few fries and it was such a waste of energy. We use this more than the oven because it has the capacity and it is easier to accommodate everything in two drawers. It’s here to stay and I do not regret spending the money. Easy to clean too, which is always a bonus.",4.0,2025-02-09,United Kingdom

Frozen chips and frozen hash browns come out lovely and crisp. I particularly like that you can use the two drawers (at the same time) at different temperatures and timings. I find that it takes about 5 minutes off of the normal cooking time. I bought the silicone baskets that are for the ninja dual zone. Make sure that when you're using the appliance, open a window.

I might still be a lousy cook but the Ninja will do its best job to make every one of my disasters at least eatable.I will make one suggestion however…The instructions were I’m quite certain written for quantum physicists.

R2LYVLAK02Z1FE,"If kitchen appliances had a superhero league, the Ninja Foodi Max Dual Zone Air Fryer would be the undisputed leader. This thing is so good, it practically has a cape hidden somewhere in its sleek design.Imagine, if you will, a world where crispy fries, succulent chicken wings, and perfectly roasted veggies coexist in harmony, and all without the guilt of deep frying. That world exists, and it’s sitting right on my kitchen counter. I call it the “Ninja Zone” and it’s every bit as epic as it sounds.First off, let’s talk about the dual-zone magic. It’s like having two personal chefs working simultaneously. Need to cook your main dish and side at the same time? No problem. One side can be sizzling away with juicy chicken breasts while the other is lovingly crisping up sweet potato fries. It’s a culinary tag team match made in heaven.The speed! Oh, the speed! This air fryer is faster than a caffeinated cheetah. My formerly chaotic dinner prep has transformed into a well-orchestrated symphony of deliciousness, with me as the maestro waving a spatula.And don’t even get me started on the clean-up, It’s so easy. Honestly, the Ninja Foodi is like having a top-tier chef and a cleaning crew rolled into one shiny, efficient package.In conclusion, the Ninja Foodi Max Dual Zone Air Fryer is not just an appliance—it’s a kitchen revolution.

R2H9VJFKXLAYFB,"I’ve always had an air fryer as I find they cook chips better than an oven, my old Tefal Actifry left a lot to be desired as it would constantly squish anything that wasn’t a chip.My old air fryer was starting to show its age with the nonstick coating starting to scratch and the discoloured plastic so it needed to be replaced.At first I was sceptical at paying nearly £200 for something that would effectively be used to cook chips however after a fair bit of research I decided to bite the bullet and order the Ninja.The first feature I like about this air fryer is the dual zones allow me to cook two meals separately, not only that but both zones are physically separated from one another meaning I can cook meat in one half and cook a meal for my partner who is meat free in the second compartment.This leads into my second favourite feature, the “sync” option, it’s unbelievably convenient to be able to cook two separate items with different cook times and have them finish at the same time.Speaking of cook times, this air fryer is a record breaker, so far everything I have cooked has been for roughly half the recommended times, I.e. chips in my old air fryer were 18-20 minutes, in the Ninja 9 minutes is plenty.Max crisp is also a highly recommended feature, for example using this setting I have cooked battered onion rings to a level that would rival a deep fat fryer with this mode.I have experienced a few occasions of soggy food, however I’ve put this down to user error by not allowing room for air flow between food items or shaking the drawers halfway through cooking like recommended.One accessory I have found invaluable for this has been a digital temperature probe, mainly due to the fact it cooks so fast it helps to have a way to verify the internal temperature, I.e. I had cooked some burgers that on the outside looked perfect, however their internal temperature was lower than expected.Physically the footprint of the fryer is small compared to competitors offers and to be honest it doesn’t look terrible left out on the worktop. One point I would like to note is during max crisp I have noticed a large amount of condensation on the wall behind the fryer, this may factor into its location.During operation the fryer makes a reasonable amount of noise, not loud enough to warrant shutting the door to hear the tv but loud enough for you to know it’s there, I’ve recorded one drawer operating at around 62 decibels which according to Google is the volume of a normal conversation.I think at some point in the future it would be handy to invest in some accessories such as the silicone liners, just to make cleaning that little bit easier. Speaking of accessories I have found tongs to be a must-have for this air fryer to safely remove large items from the drawers, tipping food out is also an option but any oil/grease that has pooled in the bottom will end up on your plate too.In summary the performance of this air fryer is, in my opinion, unrivalled for the average household, it cooks everything I have thrown at it to perfection and has nearly made my oven redundant.",5.0,2024-07-09,United Kingdom

I’d recommend a meat probe to go with in case they need a couple extra mins. I haven’t overcooked the chicken yet and have delicious juicy chicken most days. The kids prefer the chips and sausages made in here too and I have to say so do I. Cooking is made much easier.The device itself is easy to use and clean .

R306OPTRDSB1WM,"I've been late to the Air fryer party, mainly because i've seen too many epic fails online and I was resisting conformity for no rational reason. But due to recenly becoming more health conscious, I've been looking for alternative ways to cook healthier versions of the tasty fried foods we like with a lot less oil. So I bit the the proverbial bullet and just hurled myself onto the bandwagon. I am generally quite pleased with my purchase.First thing I would say is that it is pretty powerful/heats up quickly which can be a blessing and a curse. It has taken a bit of getting used to balance the amounts of food vs cooking temp and time ratio without over/under cooking. The guide is a starting point to get the settings right but is not foolproof and yes I have carbonized a number of things (chips became wingnut-esque). However when you practice and start to ""trust"" it a bit (check/rotate through the cook) you can whip up meals mid week that you would probably only have time to do on the weekend with conventional methods. I don't use the dual function too much, I cook more in the giant ""megazone"" and bought this model mainly for the bigger draw size so that there is space for the air to circulate, rather than trying too cram too much food in a small space which leads to uneven cooking. Only thing I miss from this model is being able to just take out the draw and shake contents which you can do more easily with single/small draw models, so I may get another smaller one for that reason if I manage to magic up some some counter space somehow.Finally, this was on a deal when I bought it so I feel I got good value for money. I think Ninja makes quality stuff.",5.0,2024-04-29,United Kingdom
R3T0WCEYG2NPQT,"I won’t repeat the features this Ninja Air Fryer has, as many previous reviewers have already outlined them. What I would say about this machine is that it is perfect for two people. For instance, take a simple meal such as Pukka pie & chips. 2 Pukka pies will fit perfectly diagonally in one of the trays. Enough chips to feed 2 people will be a simple thing to cook. 2 supermarket breaded / battered fish fillets also fit nicely sided by side.Once you add in a 3rd person, things can get tricky. Adding a 3rd pie or fish etc. to the mix means you will need to position them on their sides to fit, which also means they will need regular turning to avoid the part nearest the heating element in the top of the unit browning faster than the rest of the pie/fish.Adding a 3rd portion of chips will also mean constant shaking of the tray and to be honest, you will still probably end up with a few chips that haven’t browned and are still a bit raw. Trying to turn them with tongs or a wooden spoon just ends up with broken chips.The instructions do warn you about overfilling the trays however, but don’t expect to get a lot of food in each tray without a lot of ‘shaking’.Am I still happy with the Ninja? 100% yes! You just have to learn what is possible to get the best results.Start by cooking small portions and you’ll soon learn how far you can push the quantity side of things. Cooking for a family of 4 means you would probably need to cook in batches, which might not work for you as keeping food warm in your main oven sort of defeats the object of an air fryer.You can cook all sorts of delicious stuff like Peking crispy duck, Tempura king prawns, scampi, steak, chicken breasts, fabulous baked potato etc. etc. all cooked much quicker than a regular oven.Hope this helps.",5.0,2024-03-01,United Kingdom

R3URGTO074REEI,I know that the product information states that the power cable is short for a purpose - to prevent dangling power leads and children pulling the hot oven on top of them. But - at 78 cm it is just too short to reach the correctly positioned socket from the best position for our air fryer on the kitchen counter.A bit penny pinching to not supply a power lead that is at least 1 metre long. Please trust the owner to install this in a safe position - add all the warnings you feel necessary to avoid legal action but make the power lead longer.  I bought a simple extension lead of 0.5m which solved the (uncalled for) problem.,4.0,2024-12-14,United Kingdom
R31HRVOQ567R78,"We absolutely LOVE our Ninja air fryer! Since we got it, our oven has been gathering dust because we use this for almost everything. From crispy fries to perfectly roasted veggies and even juicy chicken, it handles it all with ease.The design is sleek and modern, and it blends beautifully with our bronze kitchen accessories—it looks like it was made for our countertop! Not only is it functional, but it also adds a touch of style to our kitchen.Delivery was lightning-fast, and everything arrived in perfect condition. If you're on the fence about getting an air fryer, trust me, you won't regret choosing a Ninja. It's efficient, easy to use, and makes cooking fun and healthier. Highly recommend!",5.0,2025-01-04,United Kingdom
R3LZBTD1HN5Z7R,"Don't get me wrong, I really love this air fryer. It does everything I want from it and more. I think I'm what they call a power user. Not just chips and sausages, it does soooo much more than that. You just need the imagination to use it properly. From other comments I've seen, sadly some people just don't have that imagination. Pies, lasagne, pasta bakes, jacket potatoes, toasties, roast potatoes, hunters chicken, haggis, grilling with marinades, fish (simply the best at cooking fish!)... the list goes on! Air fryers (or mini oven/grills as I prefer to call them) are definitely the way forward, along with Ninja multi-cookers! And that's without the very significant cost savings in electricity over standard ovens.The Ninja air fryer does more than many others... dehydrate, prove, bake, roast, max crisp etc. And if you break anything, you can get spare parts for them!However, there are a few tiny issues that they probably need to sort out. Firstly, the fan is a touch too fast and can't be manually adjusted, which means that any coverings, such as silicon sheets, get whipped to one side. It has even whipped the cheese off my cheese on toast before the cheese has managed to melt. But that can be worked around with a bit of imagination.Another minor issue is the lack of a viewing window. I found this really useful in my previous fryer.Another tiny gripe is that the controls/programming seems a bit daft in places. For example, there are separate temp and time controls for the left and right ovens, but you still have to select which oven you're adjusting. Also, you can't cancel/override the sync and match controls without cancelling the whole thing. There are a few little niggles like this with the controls. Nothing serious, but suggests a lack of real cooking testing.But overall I can't complain. I'll still buy another one when this one burns out.",4.0,2024-07-15,United Kingdom

R1N7AOCWY9EQML,"Previous to buying this item, our household had a small egg-shaped air fryer which was bought buy a family member as a moving-in present. We used this egg-shaped air fryer for years and always found it had issues where by the food at the bottom wouldn't cook as well as that at the top. We desperately wanted a Ninja Airfryer and so after saving up and ordering, we couldn't wait for it to arrive. On the day of its arrival, we were quick to put it to use and we couldn't believe the improvement in quality from our previous air fryer.FIRSTLY, the size improvement is the first advantage. This air fryer can hold so much and it isn't even the biggest you can get on the market. It has enough space to cook two different types of food and also with accessories can be used to cook more foods at once.SECONDLY, the quality of the cook with the item is far superior. It has a definite better airflow to it which means that the whole compartment of food is cooked properly no matter where it falls in the compartment, meaning no reduction in taste or texture no matter whether you get to plate your portion up first or last.THIRDLY, the amount of settings which the item has is much better. The item has sync, duplicate and other features which allow you to time your different foods which had different cooking times so that they automatically set off to ensure the finishing time for cooking finishes at the same time. There is also the duplicate feature which means that you can just copy the settings to the two compartments. There are also options to crisp up food with more or more traditional air fry, also dehydrate to make cocktail garnishes, I have yet to experiment with this setting but know people who have and they say it's great.FOURTH, the quality of the item is great, sturdy, and bulky which gives the impression of a good quality item, and we have been using it regularly for months and it has yet to show any signs of wear and tear.",5.0,2024-06-05,United Kingdom

R1PKZI5P08JGBO,Just a small problem.Donor rely on the written dimensions of this appliance.It’s back to  front. Depth  and width are back to front. So if your tight on space beware.Not enough cable only approximately 2 foot. Barely enough to reach a plug. At least a meter please ninja. After all it’s not a cheap Airfryer.Otherwise it does what’s on the box. Easy to clean a little noisy. Capacity is very good.,4.0,2024-12-30,United Kingdom

R2TC00XEN3SWQO,"Originally purchased when had to move to temporary accommodation whilst renovations carried out on our home. Fantastic piece of kit. Since getting it we hardly ever use the oven as the Ninja can cope with just about anything. Have made everything from curry to cakes with great success. Plenty of online groups to help with adjusting from big oven to the Ninja. Various settings to choose from, just use as described. i.e. Roast, Air Fry, Bake etc and you will soon learn how to adjust. Generally the time in the Air Fryer will be shorter than it Ould be in conventional ovens. Is the probe necessary? Depends on how confident cook you are. If you think you can judge cooking meat just by time then no, you could go for the lower model but, if you wt to get it ""just right"" then the probe can prove to be a very useful tool.  TIP: we always use silicone liners as it makes it very very easy to keep the unit clean in addition you can get a wire tray to allow you to cook on two levels if you want.",5.0,2024-10-24,United Kingdom

R2LTIH53ZOPZJT,"The reviews didn’t lie. Excellent air fryer. It cooks food really well (making them really crispy) and cooks quickly. This was the largest size. The only downside i would say is that while the capacity is large, food cooks better in a single layer but that means you can’t fit much in. If you fill the drawer then you have to be very patient, cooking food on a lower temperature and constantly turning the food to make sure it all cooks through. Slightly annoying if you’re cooking for multiple people. It’s also a little loud. However, we are really enjoying the air fryer and would recommend it.",4.0,2025-01-05,United Kingdom
